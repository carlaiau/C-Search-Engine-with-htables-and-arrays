wsj
what
is
happening
to
income
in
america
bluestone
we
see
the
following
trends
beginning
in
the
early
s
first
stagnation
if
not
an
absolute
decline
in
hourly
wages
weekly
earnings
and
average
annual
earnings
second
growing
inequality
in
earnings
particularly
among
men
third
growing
proportion
of
the
labor
force
earning
lower
wages
at
least
among
fulltime
workers
there
seems
to
have
been
very
little
reversal
in
any
of
those
trends
since
the
economic
recovery
beginning
in
levy
there
been
trend
toward
greater
inequality
in
men
earnings
in
most
of
the
postworld
war
ii
period
it
grows
faster
sometimes
than
other
times
and
that
trend
certainly
has
been
there
in
the
past
decade
there
is
no
particular
trend
one
way
or
another
in
women
earnings
if
you
look
at
family
incomes
from
the
end
of
the
second
world
war
to
the
late
s
family
incomes
grew
moderately
more
equal
they
grew
sharply
less
equal
in
the
early
s
historically
inequality
grows
when
you
go
into
recession
and
declines
when
you
come
out
but
inequality
today
is
greater
than
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
recession
when
incomes
are
growing
fast
inequality
has
less
meaning
because
the
poor
are
getting
richer
and
the
rich
are
getting
richer
even
faster
but
everybody
better
off
because
of
the
general
stagnation
of
earnings
this
decade
that
not
the
case
now
relative
decline
means
an
absolute
decline
the
sharpest
example
is
that
if
you
look
at
workers
in
their
late
s
and
early
s
with
high
school
education
in
the
early
s
they
were
averaging
in
today
dollars
and
today
they
are
making
and
the
last
point
is
that
there
have
been
sharp
changes
in
the
kinds
of
families
at
the
bottom
of
the
distribution
in
the
s
the
bottom
fifth
of
families
contained
maybe
onesixth
of
all
kids
today
it
onequarter
linden
don
think
there
much
debate
that
income
has
been
growing
much
less
rapidly
than
in
the
s
but
why
is
this
going
on
my
view
is
that
there
have
been
monumental
social
and
demographic
changes
in
the
country
but
it
remains
fact
that
percapita
disposable
income
rose
by
total
of
between
and
and
by
between
and
percapita
disposable
personal
income
rose
by
an
annual
rate
of
from
through
at
that
rate
the
standard
of
living
of
the
average
american
doubles
in
years
that
been
our
past
trend
it
is
our
current
trend
when
we
survey
young
workers
they
say
they
are
doing
considerably
better
than
their
parents
were
at
their
age
and
they
re
right
on
average
today
young
have
an
income
that
is
in
real
terms
higher
than
their
parents
at
the
same
age
vedder
from
to
economic
growth
reduced
poverty
from
to
we
see
little
if
any
decline
in
poverty
even
though
there
has
been
some
economic
growth
why
has
economic
growth
not
resulted
in
the
continuation
of
the
reduction
in
poverty
decreasing
proportion
of
the
poor
are
working
poor
of
the
million
families
that
are
poor
half
don
contain
wage
earner
public
policies
are
leading
people
to
take
options
that
consign
them
to
poverty
wsj
let
begin
by
considering
individual
earnings
from
labor
what
happening
and
why
levy
low
wages
among
young
high
school
graduates
come
from
weak
manufacturing
employment
manufacturing
got
clobbered
in
the
recession
and
then
got
the
short
end
of
the
stick
in
the
recovery
because
of
the
high
dollar
put
aside
the
question
of
good
jobs
and
bad
jobs
suppose
you
had
group
of
women
and
large
number
went
into
secretarial
positions
suddenly
you
abolish
half
of
those
jobs
women
average
wages
would
fall
even
if
those
vanished
jobs
weren
good
jobs
in
the
s
lot
of
young
men
without
college
educations
had
to
scramble
for
any
kind
of
job
because
the
factories
weren
hiring
bluestone
as
it
turns
out
and
one
of
the
proponents
of
the
deindustrialization
thesis
the
shift
in
employment
from
goods
production
to
services
does
not
by
itself
explain
the
growth
in
inequality
because
inequality
is
growing
in
all
sectors
think
something
is
happening
to
educational
criteria
went
to
public
high
school
in
detroit
and
graduated
in
about
half
my
class
went
on
to
college
half
didn
at
my
th
and
th
class
reunions
those
who
went
on
to
college
were
making
somewhat
more
than
those
who
had
not
but
the
gap
wasn
enormous
we
were
in
detroit
remember
but
when
the
class
of
meets
for
its
anniversary
predict
the
gap
will
have
grown
enormously
in
goods
production
college
graduates
earned
times
as
much
as
high
school
dropouts
in
today
they
earn
times
as
much
but
the
service
economy
is
putting
more
and
more
of
premium
on
advanced
education
so
while
college
graduates
in
services
earned
times
as
much
as
high
school
dropouts
in
today
they
earn
times
as
much
there
certainly
is
relationship
between
the
decline
in
manufacturing
employment
and
the
growth
in
inequality
but
even
more
powerful
there
has
been
restructuring
within
industries
linden
but
much
of
this
is
the
impact
of
the
baby
boom
generation
within
the
prime
age
range
of
to
when
earnings
are
at
their
highest
the
proportion
of
the
category
accounted
for
by
the
younger
less
wellpaid
cohort
of
to
yearolds
was
in
in
it
was
bluestone
but
those
are
the
same
people
who
in
the
previous
period
of
greater
equality
were
even
younger
to
and
so
they
should
have
been
lowering
wage
rates
even
more
then
linden
but
their
participation
in
the
labor
force
was
very
slight
most
of
them
were
still
in
school
levy
the
growth
in
inequality
among
younger
workers
is
as
important
as
the
growth
of
inequality
between
younger
and
older
workers
and
between
high
school
and
college
graduates
inequality
grown
lot
the
economy
in
lot
of
turbulence
wsj
perhaps
as
the
economy
becomes
more
entrepreneurial
as
foreign
competition
mounts
as
small
business
proliferates
the
price
society
is
prepared
to
pay
for
talent
is
greater
linden
there
was
period
in
which
you
could
earn
your
bread
by
the
sweat
of
your
brow
now
as
the
economy
becomes
more
complex
bluestone
you
have
to
use
something
above
the
brow
levy
the
economy
in
the
s
and
s
was
certainly
not
sclerotic
but
the
inequality
in
men
earnings
was
less
than
it
is
now
compared
to
the
early
s
larger
proportion
of
men
earns
over
in
constant
dollars
and
larger
proportion
earns
under
but
smaller
proportion
is
earning
between
and
the
top
has
increased
because
if
you
want
to
put
good
face
on
it
there
is
more
recognition
of
talent
and
if
you
want
to
put
bad
face
on
it
because
people
feel
less
of
sense
of
restraint
than
they
used
to
markets
are
there
all
the
time
but
how
much
do
you
allow
the
full
impact
of
the
market
to
come
to
bear
on
wages
and
how
much
do
you
dampen
the
market
through
custom
certainly
in
the
s
we
let
more
of
the
market
be
felt
if
the
minimum
wage
erodes
through
inflation
that
good
if
you
can
get
really
big
salary
by
threatening
to
jump
to
another
firm
even
though
it
nine
times
what
your
colleagues
are
making
go
ahead
that
ok
if
you
want
to
take
it
one
step
further
this
may
ultimately
be
traceable
to
the
stagnation
of
earnings
when
everybody
is
getting
better
off
very
fast
you
may
say
well
ve
got
mine
but
when
people
get
little
edgy
about
the
future
there
more
of
temptation
to
play
for
the
short
run
vedder
we
all
agree
that
the
growth
in
earnings
from
work
has
slowed
down
dramatically
since
the
mid
s
won
agree
to
any
specific
numbers
because
there
are
complex
issues
here
fringe
benefits
inflation
deflators
the
dates
you
use
but
don
think
there
any
question
that
the
measures
show
some
increase
in
inequality
over
the
past
years
linden
remember
that
the
period
from
the
end
of
the
war
to
the
s
was
extraordinary
we
had
depression
and
then
war
in
the
s
and
s
so
there
was
huge
backlog
of
sophisticated
technology
that
had
not
been
implementedthere
was
whole
network
of
growth
impetus
bluestone
but
there
whole
series
of
institutional
factors
at
work
too
at
one
time
in
this
country
we
had
more
than
third
of
the
labor
force
in
unions
in
manufacturing
as
much
as
by
demanding
raises
in
pennies
per
hour
rather
than
in
percentage
terms
by
fighting
for
promotion
by
seniority
rather
than
pay
for
knowledge
unions
have
been
force
for
greater
equality
with
the
demise
of
unions
you
have
freer
market
in
wages
freer
market
has
meant
greater
disparities
in
the
average
chief
executive
of
fortune
company
earned
times
as
much
as
the
average
factory
worker
and
times
as
much
as
the
average
schoolteacher
in
he
made
times
as
much
as
factory
worker
and
times
as
much
as
teacher
levy
the
big
change
was
on
the
demand
side
we
know
that
manufacturing
is
very
sensitive
to
recessions
and
we
also
know
that
in
this
last
recovery
the
high
dollar
was
very
hard
on
manufacturing
so
you
re
suddenly
taking
big
chunk
of
the
demand
for
less
welleducated
labor
and
putting
it
into
shock
linden
what
you
re
saying
is
that
we
are
having
an
economic
episode
related
to
the
fortunes
of
the
dollar
levy
would
say
yes
but
how
long
that
episode
lasts
has
lot
to
do
with
public
policy
linden
but
an
episode
is
nothing
we
have
to
be
too
desperately
concerned
about
it
painful
to
live
through
but
it
will
not
continue
levy
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
young
person
the
question
is
what
are
the
chances
that
they
re
going
to
outearn
their
parents
that
depends
on
something
can
predict
very
well
productivity
growth
yearold
man
today
is
pretty
certainly
making
more
than
his
father
did
when
he
was
the
difference
is
that
the
father
saw
pretty
rapid
wage
growth
for
most
of
his
career
for
the
son
it
an
open
question
if
you
do
simple
projections
you
will
find
that
for
the
collegeeducated
son
of
collegeeducated
father
the
son
will
top
out
at
about
or
constant
dollars
more
than
his
father
which
isn
outstanding
but
isn
bad
but
for
high
schooleducated
sons
of
high
schooleducated
fathers
at
current
projections
the
son
won
outearn
his
father
wsj
what
about
collegeeducated
sons
of
high
schooleducated
fathers
levy
the
proportion
of
high
school
graduates
going
on
to
college
has
stabilized
at
since
the
early
s
linden
but
in
the
generation
of
the
fathers
of
the
babyboomers
only
went
to
college
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
notion
of
the
babyboomers
not
doing
as
well
as
their
parents
is
nonsense
of
course
while
they
re
doing
better
now
this
is
only
snapshot
in
time
will
they
do
better
into
the
future
that
as
unpredictable
as
tomorrow
gnp
vedder
from
until
we
had
an
increase
in
equality
combined
with
economic
growth
since
we
ve
had
an
increase
of
inequality
along
with
some
slowing
of
economic
growth
but
over
the
long
run
that
trend
will
probably
reverse
itself
even
in
the
absence
of
public
policy
what
we
should
be
worrying
about
are
the
very
poor
we
have
not
been
terribly
successful
in
eliminating
poverty
in
the
united
states
that
where
we
should
focus
our
attention
wsj
how
important
are
racial
and
regional
phenomena
vedder
the
employmenttopopulation
rate
among
blacks
was
higher
in
than
it
was
in
vs
for
whites
it
rose
from
to
don
think
anyone
would
seriously
argue
that
it
because
of
increased
racial
discrimination
part
of
the
black
decline
does
relate
to
things
like
changing
skill
requirements
but
part
of
it
relates
to
family
structure
and
to
things
that
affect
work
effort
like
public
assistance
levy
of
course
for
femaleheaded
families
earning
less
than
are
white
vedder
maybe
but
among
unrelated
individuals
inequality
for
whites
has
fallen
for
blacks
it
has
risen
if
you
compare
families
the
gini
coefficient
the
technical
measure
of
inequality
has
risen
basis
points
for
blacks
and
for
whites
and
income
disparity
among
blacks
was
greater
than
among
whites
to
begin
with
bluestone
while
this
is
true
among
blacks
it
part
of
general
trend
the
white
high
school
graduate
or
dropout
isn
doing
as
well
as
years
ago
either
in
both
relative
and
absolute
terms
vedder
and
for
regions
reversing
the
recent
history
of
the
it
been
the
relatively
high
income
states
that
had
the
highest
growth
rates
in
the
s
bluestone
in
the
six
new
england
states
the
proportion
of
the
work
force
in
lowwage
jobs
went
down
between
and
but
everywhere
else
it
went
up
in
the
midwest
it
began
rising
in
and
exploded
after
from
to
in
the
south
it
went
from
to
in
the
west
from
to
levy
but
most
of
that
decline
is
concentrated
in
the
middle
west
if
you
take
out
the
big
industrial
states
the
high
schoolcollege
gap
in
wage
rates
among
young
men
hasn
changed
whole
lot
and
there
your
story
heavy
industry
is
falling
apart
linden
but
autos
and
steel
account
for
just
or
of
total
employment
we
have
lost
vastly
more
industrial
jobs
in
lowpaying
textile
and
apparel
industries
levy
it
isn
just
autos
and
steel
that
are
being
removed
when
you
take
out
those
states
bluestone
and
even
for
people
in
textiles
those
jobs
are
better
than
the
alternatives
working
as
security
guards
or
janitors
or
in
warehouses
or
frying
hamburgers
and
the
benefits
of
course
were
much
greater
even
in
the
lowerwage
manufacturing
industries
wsj
let
go
beyond
the
individual
earnings
data
what
happening
to
total
family
income
levy
income
per
worker
really
has
slowed
down
family
living
standards
haven
suffered
as
much
but
that
because
we
now
have
twoincome
families
with
one
kid
instead
of
oneincome
families
with
three
kids
and
also
because
even
as
maleearnings
inequality
has
grown
femaleincome
inequality
has
been
unchanged
linden
in
the
lowest
quintile
of
the
family
income
distribution
singleparent
families
grew
between
and
from
to
of
the
total
family
population
over
those
years
there
was
increase
in
the
number
of
husbandwife
families
while
other
families
increased
by
of
the
total
increase
between
and
in
households
earning
less
than
were
single
individuals
were
femaleheaded
families
in
the
top
quintile
of
families
there
has
been
an
extraordinary
growth
in
the
number
of
working
wives
in
some
of
the
families
in
the
top
fifth
had
working
wives
in
some
the
number
of
working
wives
in
the
top
quintile
increased
by
how
much
do
these
pulls
increase
inequality
it
difficult
to
say
but
these
are
not
small
changes
these
are
monumental
changes
because
the
baby
boom
was
monumental
just
between
and
the
total
number
of
persons
working
went
up
by
vedder
in
real
terms
not
in
nominal
terms
in
real
terms
payments
to
individuals
by
the
united
states
government
went
up
from
billion
dollars
in
to
billion
in
that
has
implications
for
all
kinds
of
things
including
family
structure
and
work
effort
among
lowincome
americans
there
is
very
significant
negative
tax
in
the
form
of
new
benefits
that
have
appeared
since
the
s
medicaid
food
stamps
wic
benefits
that
have
impacted
adversely
on
lowincome
americans
participation
in
the
labor
force
at
the
upper
end
of
the
spectrum
meanwhile
labor
force
participation
is
increasing
why
partly
because
you
have
some
impact
when
you
cut
the
marginal
tax
rate
from
to
levy
but
inequality
in
family
incomes
increases
faster
when
you
ignore
wives
incomes
the
twoincome
family
exerts
less
of
an
equalizing
force
than
it
did
years
ago
because
it
more
acceptable
for
the
wives
of
highincome
men
to
work
than
it
used
to
be
but
even
so
if
you
ignored
all
wives
incomes
you
have

mr

said
the

could

more
fuelefficient

the
boeing

he
reported
that
they
love
their
country
the
german
democratic
republic
not
the
federal
republic
of
the
west
they
believe
in
socialism
still
mr
bernstein
could
file
this
amazing
dispatch
only
because
his
interviews
were
done
in

berlin
the
one
part
of

that
clearly
resisted
the

in

some
western
analysts
have
attributed
the
conservatives
victory
to
their
supposedly
massive
rural

but
the
results
indicate
otherwise
conservatives
ran
behind
the
vote
for
the
parties
of
the
left
in
the
most
rural
regions
of
the
country
but
the
conservatives
triumphed
in
the
densely
populated
industrial
areas
of
thuringia
and
saxony
the
prewar
heartland
of
german
socialism
the
left
won
only
of
the

once
called

the
pearl
of

it
an
image
grew
up
with
although
have
never
been
to
east
africa
when
was
seven
years
old
my
physician
father
was
persuaded
by
former

who
had
gone
to

to
teach
in
an
anglican

school
to
pay
the
modest

the
two
of
us
became
pen
pals
and
my
personal
tie
to
uganda
was
formed
the
obvious
thing
to
say
now
is
that
my
pen
pal
whom
have
met
twice
in
this
country
is
still
alive
mention
uganda
nowadays
and
people
do
not
think
of
schoolgirls
singing
on
hillside
above
lake
victoria
on
the
contrary
they
think
or
try
not
to
think
of
the
devastating
horror
of
the
past
years
as
the
northernbased
armies
of
milton
obote
and
idi
amin
imposed
brutal
and
genocidal
tyranny
on
their
longstanding
southern
rivals
the
horror
has
abated
since
when
the
exiled
leader
yoweri
museveni
seized
the
government
and
instituted
policy
of
amnesty
and
national
reconciliation
but
now
another
horror
is
loose
in
uganda
aids
while
some
epidemiologists
debate
the
theory
that
one
of
the
aids
viruses
originated
in
the
area
of
the
ugandantanzanian
border
others
are
rightly
more
concerned
with
fighting
the
disease
which
according
to
some

now
infects

is

bishop
or
distinguished

popular
singer
named
philly

who
is
dying
of

mr
lutaaya
public
announcement
of
his
condition
and
his
travels
throughout
uganda
to
educate
his
people
about
aids
is
the
subject

in

special
combined
edition
of
frontline
and
the
aids
quarterly
airing
tomorrow
est
on
pbs
check
local
listings
in

aids
is
called
slim
for
reasons
that
are
obvious
when
we
look
at
mr
lutaaya
frail
as
reed
and
unhealthily
reddish
in
color
except
for
the
purple
welts
on
his
skin
he
wears
wraparound
sunglasses
to
protect
his
eyes
while
delivering
his
message
to
the
students
let
us
do
our
best
to
have
virusfree
young
generation
it
easy
to
avoid
getting
the
virus
beseech
you
please
be
careful
in
the
way
you
handle
yourselves
we
need
you
the
message
seems
simple
enough
and
certainly
mr
lutaaya
who
died
in
december
is
an
eloquent
messenger
early
in
the
film
the
doctor
who
had
been
treating
mr
lutaaya
in
stockholm
describes
the
severity
of
the
infections
tumors
and
foot
sores
that
in
his
view
already
have
doomed
the
singer
to
bedridden
existence
yet
mr
lutaaya
defies
this
prognosis
by
getting
up
recording
what
would
become
hit
song
about
aids
and
then
making
the
arduous
journey
back
to
uganda
yet
the
message
gets
more
complicated
as
we
follow
mr
lutaaya
through
an
itinerary
that
includes
great
many
stops
besides
gayaza
part
of
the
fascination
of
this
film
made
by
the
awardwinning
canadian
film
makers
virginia
storring
and
john
zaritskyis
is
its
vivid
portrait
of
contemporary
africa
as
place
where
the
incursion
of
the
modern
world
is
both
blessing
and
curse
while
still
in
kampala
mr
lutaaya
attends
party
in
the
neighborhood
bar
where
he
got
his
start
as
musician
here
we
are
reminded
of
the
extreme
moral
permissiveness
that
has
existed
in
urban
africa
for
the
past
several
decades
this
particular
gathering
is
sober
one
but
it
clear
that
the
bar
is
usually
spot
where
the
music
jumps
the
beer
flows
and
traditional
sexual
morality
whether
tribal
christian
or
moslem
falls
by
the
wayside
such
liberated
environments
attract
young
uprooted
people
who
tend
to
be
malnourished
and
afflicted
with
various
maladies
including
venereal
diseases
that
have
gone
untreated
since
the
collapse
of
the
ugandan
health
system
in
the
early
s
most
researchers
agree
that
it
is
this
combination
of
unfettered
sexual
activity
and
poor
health
that
has
caused
aids
to
become
heterosexually
transmitted
epidemic
in
africa
therefore
in
the
spirit
of
scientific
reason
mr
lutaaya
tries
to
convince
people
in
mosques
churches
remote
villages
including
his
own
and
the
depopulated
ghost
towns
along
the
transafrican
highway
that
aids
is
publichealth
hazard
not
the
work
of
witchcraft
or
punishment
sent
by
god
he
tactfully
explains
how
the
virus
is
transmitted
and
urges
his
listeners
not
to
shun
or
mistreat
its
victims
here
the
complications
begin
however
by
insisting
on
nonjudgmental
attitude
mr
lutaaya
may
be
inadvertently
furthering
the
process
of
secularization
that
contributed
to
the
problem
in
the
first
place
given
the
role
of
religious
differences
in
uganda
civil
strife
we
understand
why
mr
lutaaya
disapproves
when
group
of
youngsters
presents
him
with
song
blaming
rebellious
and
promiscuous
people
for
bringing
aids
into
their
village
where
it
now
kills
the
innocent
yet
mr
lutaaya
is
caught
on
the
horns
of
dilemma
and
he
is
hardly
alone
publichealth
officials
and
religious
leaders
throughout
africa
agree
that
the
best
weapon
against
aids
is
return
to
monogamy
or
in
the
case
of
islam
and
traditional
religions
polygamy
as
long
as
husbands
and
wives
both
remain
faithful
but
the
only
way
to
restore
these
moral
codes
is
to
strengthen
belief
which
is
also
the
source
of
superstition
and
intolerance
can
people
adopt
strict
moral
behavior
without
rendering
strict
judgment
on
the
behavior
of
others
in
the
west
where
aids
may
not
reach
epidemic
levels
we
can
afford
this
kind
of
pragmatic
pseudosolution
for
us
the
horns
of
the
ageold
dilemma
of
religious
toleration
have
become
comfortably
blunt
but
the
same
cannot
be
said
of
africa
as
this
film
ably
demonstrates
the
fascination
and
the
sorrow
of
africa
is
that
it
is
place
where
all
human
problems
show
up
with
the
sharpness
of
razor

still
ailing
from
lower
profit
margins
despite
measures
last
year
to
cut
costs
is
expected
to
report
another
quarter
of
reduced
profit
most
analysts
in
the
past
two
weeks
have
dropped
firstquarter
earnings
estimates
to
cents
share
for
the
photographic
chemical
and
pharmaceutical
concern
in
the
yearago
period
kodak
earned
million
or
cents
share
on
sales
of
billion
our
assumption
was
that
there
was
going
to
be
snap
back
of

from

continuation
of
last
year
difficulties
kodak
which
won
report
its
results
until
may
refuses
to
comment
on
analysts
profit
projections
but
the
company
has
maintained
that
much
of
the
costcutting
measures
taken
late
last
year
won
bolster
results
until
later
this
year
we
ve
said
all
along
that
our
restructuring
will
be
felt
in
the
second
half
company
spokesman
said
last
august
after
sixmonth
net
income
slid
kodak
announced
its
fourth
restructuring
plan
since
under
the
latest
plan
the
company
said
it
would
divest
itself
of
businesses
and
eliminate
about
jobs
in
the
to
generate
as
much
as
billion
in
cash
flow
this
year
so
far
the
company
has
divested
itself
of
its
minilab
products
and
overhead
projector
business
and
closed
its
professional
videotape
businesses
among
others
the
company
two
weeks
ago
also
sold
its
floppy
disk
unit
the
largest
business
yet
to
be
sold
under
its
restructuring
effort
analysts
estimate
the
unit
was
sold
for
about
million
for
an
estimated
pretax
gain
of
million
most
of
the
businesses
sold
or
closed
were
in
the
information
systems
group
which
has
been
hurt
by
high
administrative
costs
for
the
business
group
was
barely
profitable
generating
operating
profit
of
million
before
charges
on
sales
of
billion
analysts
foresee
little
improvement
in
the
group
business
outlook
this
year
moreover
sectors
that
had
been
strong
such
as
kodak
chemical
group
are
coming
under
greater
pressure
from
the
weak
economy
operating
profit
is
expected
to
fall
this
year
adding
to
firstquarter
woes
has
been
the
relative
strength
of
the
dollar
overseas
particularly
in
japan
besides
making
kodak
exports
more
expensive
in
overseas
markets
the
strong
dollar
also
lowers
foreign
currency
earnings
sales
overseas
represented
about
of
total
sales
for
kodak
last
year
the
company
notes
however
that
demand
for
consumer
photographic
film
kodak
cash
cow
continues
strong
despite
the
company
higher
than
normal
price
increase
last
december
price
increases
have
been
accepted
by
the
market
said
analyst
donald
zwyer
of
kidder
peabody
co
he
estimates
the
price
increase
will
contribute
about
half
of
the
sales
gain

recycling
is

since

many

questioned
whether
recycling
will
ever
fulfill

dream
of

crisis
but
new

kicking
off

morning
in

colo
suggests
that
recycling
potential
may
be
far
greater
than
generally
thought
the
kencaryl

will
pick
up
approximately
different

found
in

even
on

with
more
to
be
added
after

gets

as

and

up

the

also
will
pick
up
every
shape
and
color
of
glass
plus
large
number
of
paper
products
including
corrugated

says
kencaryl

who
pushed
for
the
comprehensive
recycling
program
along
with
several
other
residents
throwing
out
huge
balls
of
aluminum
foil
and
even
my
old
lawn
chairs
she
says
the
kencaryl
program
has
other
advantages
over
most
of
the
or
so
existing
curbside
recycling
programs
one
is
that
homeowners
won
be
asked
to
sort
their
recyclables
task
that
has
been
real
turnoff
for
some
but
rather
will
only
have
to
put
everything
into
giant
gallon
bin
the
big
items
can
be
put
out
separately
pickup
will
be
once

by

unit
of
laidlaw
transportation
ltd
of
canada
which
will
have
compactor
truck
follow
its
regular
garbage
truck
through
the
home
community
another
advantage
is
cost
according
to
trir
systems
corp
denverbased
recycling
firm
that
will
sort
and
sell
the
recycled
items
picked
up
by
laidlaw
the
typical
curbside
recycling
program
currently
costs
about
per
household
per
month
of
that
amount
about
cents
flows
back
to
the
community
from
the
revenue
generated
by
the
sale
of
the
recycled
goods
by
contrast
the
kencaryl
program
will
generate
about
cents
to
cents
per
household
back
to
the
community
according
to
trir
chairman
and
president
david
powelson
moreover
the
additional
revenue
will
come
from
more
reliable
metals
markets
offsetting
the
wide
price
swings
for
newspaper
and
glass
that
have
recently
hurt
many
municipal
programs
mr
powelson
says
that
among
the
other
items
scheduled
to
be
added
to
the
kencaryl
program
are
tin
cans
junk
mail
and
polystyrene
the
latter
has
been
banned
by
some
municipalities
but
mr
powelson
says
that
since
the
food
and
drug
administration
recently
agreed
to
let
recycled
polystyrene
be
used
for
making
egg
cartons
trir
will
soon
have
resale
market
for
that
plastic
material
still
there
are
some
things
most
homeowners
commonly
throw
away
that
won
be
picked
up
batteries
and
motor
oil
are
two
of
them
mr
powelson
explains
that
because
both
are
listed
as
hazardous
substances
picking
them
up
would
be
like
picking
up
asbestos
another
common
throwaway
the
telephone
book
also
isn
on
the
list
even
though
telephone
books
have
been
singled
out
by
environmentalists
for
needlessly
filling
up
scarce
landfill
space
the
problem
says
mr
powelson
is
that
the
only
market
for
old
telephone
books
is
small
market
overseas
some
countries
use
telephonebook
pages
to
wrap
fruit

to

national

the

it

rigorously
conservative

on

it

through

and
the
absence

without
any
seeming
concern
for
the
appropriate
role
of

what
does
the
democratic
party
stand
for
as
an
alternative
to
this
program
it
is
exceedingly
hard
to
tell
because
the
democrats
are
not
an
opposition
party
the
democrats
share
power
they
do
not

it
seeking
power
requires
submitting
alternatives
to
the

and
competing
for
their
allegiance
sharing
power
is
an
entirely
different
role
the
democratic

damage
from

injuries
frequently
the
cause
of
paralysis
can
be
significantly
reduced
by
large
doses
of
common
generic
drug
administered
shortly
after
an
accident
medical
researchers
reported
the
finding
represents
breakthrough
in
dealing
with
injuries
that
afflict
about
victims
year
mainly
young
men
hurt
in
auto
accidents
many
end
up
spending
their
lives
in
wheelchairs
caring
for
victims
of
spinalcord
injury
costs
the
government
about
billion
year
until
recently
there
was
little
doctors
could
do
to
lessen
the
destruction
of
such
injury
but
researchers
found
that
large
doses
of
methylprednisolone
commonly
used
antiinflamatory
drug
given
within
eight
hours
of
spinalcord
injury
can
limit
damage
the
study
provides
significant
evidence
that
neurological
deficits
can
be
reduced
if
treated
quickly
reported
michael
bracken
professor
of
epidemiology
at
the
yale
school
of
medicine
one
of
the
coordinators
of
the
tests
he
said
the
use
of
massive
doses
of
methylprednisolone
shortly
after
the
accident
can
in
some
cases
mean
the
difference
between
being
able
to
use
walker
and
being
restricted
to
wheelchair
in
other
cases
he
said
patients
who
might
otherwise
be
paralyzed
from
the
neck
down
might
be
able
to
regain
some
use
of
their
hands
because
of
the
new
therapy
the
study
which
featured
clinical
trials
involving
treatment
of
victims
of
spinalcord
injuries
at
medical
centers
was
sponsored
by
the
national
institute
of
neurological
disorders
and
stroke
one
of
the
national
institutes
of
health
results
will
be
published
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
next
month
the
tests
compared
patients
treated
with
methylprednisolone
who
received
naloxone
an
antinarcotic
addiction
drug
that
tests
had
suggested
might
hold
promise
for
treating
spinalcord
injuries
and
patients
receiving
placebo
six
months
after
their
injuries
the
patients
treated
with
methylprednisolone
showed
nearly
greater
improvement
in
motor
skills
and
more
than
twice
the
improvement
in
their
ability
to
experience
touch
than
patients
on
the
placebo
naloxone
didn
turn
out
to
be
an
effective
treatment
the
key
to
success
is
applying
massive
doses
of
the
drug
within
eight
hours
of
an
accident
explained
phanor
perot
chairman
of
the
department
of
neurological
surgery
at
the
medical
university
of
south
carolina
one
of
the
centers
involved
in
the
study
doctors
gave
an
initial
dose
of
milligrams
of
methylprednisolone
for
each
kilogram
pounds
of
body
weight
followed
by
an
infusion
of
milligrams
per
kilogram
per
hour
for
hours
the
drugs
were

this
treatment

the
amounts
used
in
the
institute
study
called
the
national
acute
spinal
cord
injury
study
spinal
injuries
rarely
sever
the
spinal
cord
instead
they
trigger
swelling
and
series
of
chemical
reactions
that
over
time
damage
nerve
cells
in
the
spinal
cord
methylprednisolone
arrests
some
of
this
disintegration
scientists
don
know
exactly
how
it
works
but
they
believe
it
improves
the
blood
flow
to
the
injured
area
and
reduces
swelling
scientists
used
methylprednisolone
after
animal
tests
suggested
that
it
might
work
on
humans
the
new
therapy
has
been
so
successful
that
the
investigators
recommended
that
doctors
start
using
it
to
treat
spinal
cord
injuries
in
addition
they
suggested
that
paramedics
could
be
trained
to
administer
the
therapy
dr
perot
said
that
the
success
of
the
methylprednisolone
therapy
suggests
that
there
may
be
other
drugs
that
will
interrupt
or
slow
the
cell
disintegration
that
damages
spinal
cords
in
the
hours
following
injuries
we
may
need
whole
salad
of
drugs
to
arrest
the
cell
disintegration
process
he
said
another
area
of
research
is
focusing
on
cell
grafts
and
regeneration
to
patch
damaged
nerve
fibers
once
you
limit
the
initial
damage
the
next
phase
is
how
to
repair
it
explained
barbara

the

the

digital

had
hard

in

for

robert

it
this

these
were
not
the
sorts
of
perceptions
that
would
have
survived
the
brutal
reductions
of
the
television

the
narrow
boundaries
of
hardnews
writing
or
the
quantifications
of
the
thinktank
analysts
in

and

mr

until
recently
freelance
reporter
based
in
athens
is
also
the
author
of
surrender
or
starve
book
about
the
barbarous
governmentmanufactured
famine
in
ethiopia
and
his
experience
shows
indeed
his
admitted
hostility
toward
other
manifestations
of
islam
makes
his
appreciation
of
the
afghans
all
the
more
impressive
ecause
afghans
harbored
no
political
insecurities
and
were
more
relaxed
in
their
faith
than
arabs
or
iranians
he
writes
islam
in
afghanistan
manifested
certainty
and
unintimidating
dynamism
that
did
not
exist
in
iran
pakistan
or
any
of
the
arab
countries
had
visited
his
combination
of
firsthand
war
experience
inside
afghanistan
and
extensive
reporting
out
of
peshawar
base
of
the
sevenparty
alliance
makes
him
sensitive
to
distinctions
that
often
escaped
even
devoted
promoters
of
the
muj
local
shorthand
for
the
freedom
fighters
the
peshawar
crowd
often
ridiculed
the
more
westernized
mujahedeen
many
of
whom
had
relatives
in
britain
and
the
the
national
islamic
front
of
afghanistan
for
example
was
dubbed
the
gucci
muj
and
compared
unfavorably
with
more
rustic
warriors
but
the
fact
that
members
of
their
families
were
abroad
meant
that
they
had
other
options
writes
mr
kaplan
who
wonders
whether
that
makes
their
decision
to
stay
and
fight
all
the
more
significant
equally
telling
are
his
criticisms
of
gulbuddin
hekmatyar
the
one
fundamentalist
party
leader
whose
zealous
struggle
to
turn
afghanistan
into
centrally
controlled
theocracy
recalls
the
ayatollah
khomeini
mr
hekmatyar
has
long
been
accused
of
killing
more
muj
than
soviets
but
that
never
stopped
disproportionate
share
of
aid
from
flowing
through
pakistan
into
mr
hekmatyar
coffers
just
last

report
by

republican

why
mr

party
fracticidal
fighting

resistance
groups
its
close
and
growing
cooperation
with
both
tehran
and
kabul
and
its
active
participation
in
antiu
international
terrorism
have
had
little
or
no
effect
on
the
delivery
of
cia
assistance
by
contrast
there
is
abdul
haq
the
charismatic
selfmade
commander
responsible
for
the
kabul
area
who
is
often
unjustly
lumped
with
mr
hekmatyar
though
no
less
devout
mr
haq
vision
of
afghanistan
couldn
be
more
distinct
decentralized
traditional
afghanistan
where
local
rulers
hold
real
power
his
visit
with
margaret

and
ronald
reagan
moreover
is
credited
with
washington
decision
to
provide
the
afghans
with
the
allimportant

that
my

his

before
him
fought

british

remembers
mr

so
asked
her
now
that
the
russians
have
finally
come
as
the
british
once
feared
why
are
you
so
quiet
mr
kaplan
rounds
out
his
story
with
nicely
detailed
descriptions
of
the
minor
but
no

colorful
types
drifting

there
is
john

whose
goal
is

with
his
bare

at
the
outset
of
the
book
mr
kaplan
dismisses
many
of
them
as
war
freaks
but
it
seems
hardly
fair
for
him
to
blast
the
bigname
press
and
the
international
organizations
for
their
reluctance
to
assume
great
risks
and
hardships
in
covering
afghanistan
and
then
complain
about
the
few
hardy
souls
who
did
rise
however
imperfectly
to
that
challenge
but
this
is
quibble

otherwise

tempering

many

have
less
need
to
go
out
of

way
to

the

bailout
of
the

all
that
might
be

good
news
for

around

full
percentage

below
the

stanley

officer
said
the

increase
reflects
higher
sales
of
rubbermaid
housewares
and
lower
rawmaterials
costs
the
executive
said
in
an
interview
mr
gault
said
revenue
in
the
quarter
rose
slightly
from
million
in
the
first
quarter
the
revenue
gains
would
have
been
stronger
officials
said
had
rubbermaid
not
held
back
on
its
retail
inventorybuilding
due
to
concerns
about
the
economy
we
want
merchandise
to
move
through
the
stores
not
just
get
the
numbers
up
mr
gault
said
in
its
core
housewares
division
orders
from
retailers
were
on
the
light
side
during
the
early
weeks
of
the
quarter
but
have
improved
said
walter
williams
president
and
chief
operating
officer
despite
some
worries
about
the
economy
rubbermaid
continues
its
fastpaced
rate
of
new
product
rollouts
the
company
unveiled
new
housewares
and
specialty
products
in
january
including
item
line
of
brooms
and
brushes
rubbermaid
is
optimistic
of
fast
growth
in
that
category
despite
the
mature
state
of
the
market
the
reason
larger
retailers
could
choose
to
stock
the
rubbermaid
line
instead
of
buying
variety
of
products
from
numerous
suppliers
besides
rubbermaid
hopes
to
create
more
demand
by
boosting
its
advertising
and
promotion
spending
on
that
product
line
and
others
we
want
to
further
enhance
our
image
with
the
consumer
mr
gault
said
last
year
advertising
and
promotion
budget
was
about
of
sales
or
about
million
for
that
will
increase
slightly
although
the
company
officials
didn
offer
details
one
factor
is
how
much
rubbermaid
saves
on
its
rawmaterial
costs
the
company
expects
polyethylene
prices
to
drop
during
the
year
as
suppliers
add
capacity
to

little

quarter
mr

said
the
division
new
management
is
considering
how
to
expand
that
business
the
company
commercial
products
business
should
show
average
growth
in
the
quarter
after
lagging
behind
in
mr
williams
said
one
factor
is
the
cautious
spending
among
foodservice
companies
and
others
for
all
of
rubbermaid
agrees
with
analysts
earnings
estimates
of
between
and
share
mr
gault
said
with
revenue
for
the
year
topping
last
year
billion
however
the
revenue
figure
won
include
about
million
in
sales
from
the
housewares
business
in
europe
those
sales
are
now
part
of
joint
venture
that
isn
consolidated
in
rubbermaid
income
statement
capital
spending
is
expected
to
climb
to
about
million
in
the
increase
will
cover
new
product
introductions
equipment
replacements
and
other

mr

said
during

rubbermaid
will

canceled
its

and

for

norton
worcester
mass

maker
said
it
needed
more
time
to
weigh
alternatives
to
btr
bid
which
it
also
rejected
as
inadequate
if
we
get
the
date
reinstated
we
ll
start
our
proxy
fight
quite
soon
said
john

btr
chief
executive
officer
in
telephone
interview
btr
had
given
norton
until
friday
to
accept
its
offer
or
face
possible
proxy
fight
but
if
the
june
special
meeting
date
were
allowed
to
stand
mr
cahill
indicated
any
proxy
fight
wouldn
begin
for
some
weeks
in
arguing
that
the
annual
meeting
should
proceed
april
as
scheduled
btr
noted
that
norton
corporate
bylaws
state
that
the
annual
meeting
be
held
on
the
fourth
thursday
in
april
and
that
no
change
in
the
date
of
the
annual
meeting
of
stockholders
may
be
made
within
days
before
the
date
fixed
in
these
bylaws
btr
contended
that
norton
board
has
tried
to
get
around
the
bylaws
by
cancelling
the
annual
meeting
and
resurrecting
it
in
the
form
of
special
meeting
but
that
such
change
is
impermissible
in
response
to
btr
request
for
an
expedited
hearing
on
the
annualmeeting
issue
the
court
scheduled
hearing
for
april
btr
suit
also
asks
the

to
declare
null

plan
and
to
declare
that
certain
antitakeover
laws
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
are
inapplicable
in
the
norton
takeover
fight
norton
said
it
would
vigorously
oppose
the
btr
suit
and
filed
its
own
suit
in
federal
court
in
boston
seeking
to
enjoin
btr
tender
offer
and
to
stop
btr
from
soliciting
proxies
norton
charged
that
btr
has
violated
federal
securities
laws
by
among
other
things
failing
to
disclose
its
practice
and
pattern
of
closing
or
moving
plants
and
laying
off
workers
after
various
acquisitions
it
has
made
the
btr
chief
executive
said
norton
rejection
of
the
bid
was
very
weak
response
he
added
norton
made
no
reference
to
shareholder
value
and
there
is
no
expectation
that
norton
can
do
anything
shortterm
or
mediumterm
to
improve
the
company
operating
prospects
mr
cahill
urged
norton
board
to
provide
btr
and
other
norton
holders
with
whatever
information
it
used
to
conclude
that
btr
bid
was
inadequate
btr
owns
fractional
stake
in
norton
mr
cahill
noted
that
before
btr
made
its
ashare
bid
last
month
norton
share
price
never
had
exceeded

the

history
in

mr

said
he
expected
to
meet
massachusetts
sens
edward
kennedy
and
john
kerry
in
washington
this
week
to
try
to
defuse
political
opposition
to
btr
bid
we
want
to
sit
down
in
spirit
of
good
will
and
explain
the
benefits
of
the
bid
to
norton
and
to
the
city
of
worcester
mr
cahill
said
he
also
said
btr
would
run
norton
as
freestanding
independent
company
using
norton
current
management
he
held
out
the
possibility
that
btr
might
make
capital
investments
in
norton
norton
capital
investments
went
flat
in
the
last

and
don

why
he
said
perhaps
it
was

wednesday
mr

substances
some
in

said
that

votes

washington
for
six
months
george
bush
has
collected
victories
in
the
cold
war
without
having
to
do
much
to
earn
them
communist
regimes
were
toppled
across
eastern
europe
without
much
help
from
the
but
now
that
lithuania
is
seeking
to
carry
the
east
bloc
selfdetermination
movement
inside
the
borders
of
the
soviet
union
the
president
job
isn
so
easy
any
more
mr
bush
has
to
struggle
to
sustain
his
two
major
foreignpolicy
themes
support
for
the
democratic
surge
in
territories
ruled
by
moscow
and
cheerleading
for
soviet
president
mikhail
gorbachev
whose
recent
decrees
appear
aimed
at
preventing
the
uprising
from
penetrating
his
borders
when
mr
bush
meets
soviet
foreign
minister
eduard
shevardnadze
at
the
white
house
in
few
days
he
has
to
find
way
to
reconcile
those
two
roles
without
appearing
to
sell
out
little
lithuania
last
week
when
reporter
tried
to
force
the
president
hand
by
asking
him
how
the
would
respond
to
crackdown
mr
bush
reacted
sharply
too
hypothetical
stop
right
there
the
president
barked
am
not
going
to
make
an
answer
to
hypothetical
question
of
that
nature
what
possible
good
could
come
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
standing
halfway
around
the
world
speculating
on
something
that
he
doesn
want
to
see
happen
mean
could
inadvertently
cause
something
bad
to
happen
eager
to
preserve
warm
relations
with
mr
gorbachev
the
administration
has
declined
to
recognize
lithuania
declaration
of
independence
despite
urgent
requests
from
vilnius
and
year
policy
of
refusing
to
recognize
the
soviet
annexation
of
lithuania
and
the
other
baltic
republics
after
few
days
last
week
of
expressing
concern
about
soviet
intimidation
the
toned
down
its
public
comments
for
fear
of
provoking
trouble
and
even
in
private
communications
between
secretary
of
state
james
baker
and
mr
shevardnadze
facetoface
meeting
in
africa
and
cable
last
week
the
has
taken
great
care
to
avoid
spelling
out
what
crackdown
in
lithuania
would
cost
mr
gorbachev
in
terms
of
relations
with
the
the
president
own
letter
to
mr
gorbachev
late
last
week
appears
to
have
been
similarly
careful
the
president
message
to
president
gorbachev
simply
reaffirmed
our
position
as
stated
many
times
white
house
spokesman
marlin
fitzwater
said
he
added
that
it
clearly
stated
the
president
support
and
the
american
support
for
the
aspirations
of
the
lithuanian
people
for
selfdetermination
statement
that
clearly
isn
the
same
as
backing
the
immediate
independence
the
lithuanians
have
declared
mr
bush
himself
said
the
letter
was
sent
because
want
to
be
sure
that
the
soviets
understand
our
position
and
understand
that
we
are
not
trying
to
make
things
difficult
for
lithuania
or
for
the
soviet
union
or
anybody
else
there
are
three
major
reasons
for
this
caution
first
administration
officials
are
convinced
mr
gorbachev
will
let
lithuania
go
peacefully
so
long
as
it
can
be
done
gradually
on
moscow
terms
second
they
argue
privately
that
the
politically
inexperienced
lithuanian
leaders
erred
by
quickly
declaring
independence
rather
than
entering
talks
with
moscow
under
soviet
law
the
president
himself
said
recently
there
are
certain
realities
in
life
the
lithuanians
are
well
aware
of
them
and
they
should
talk
as
they
are
with
the
soviet
officials
finally
and
most
importantly
mr
bush
and
mr
baker
privately
admire
mikhail
gorbachev
and
are
convinced
they
are
within
few
months
of
concluding
important
business
with
him
vast
scaling
down
of
soviet
military
power
an
agreement
to
unite
germany
on
western
terms
and
an
opportunity
to
open
the
to
marketbased
investment
we
are
so
close
to
so
much
says
one
very
senior
official
that
why
we
want
to
try
to
get
this
lithuania
thing
behind
us
this
is
by
far
the
touchiest
moment
for
foreign
policy
in
the
bush
presidency
if
the
conflict
in
lithuania
settles
down
into
negotiations
without
an
armed
crackdown
the
bushbaker
approach
will
look
brilliant
if
not
the
president
will
be
accused
of
selling
out
small
budding
democracy
to
further
bigpower

to

he
says
that
staggering
the
chicago
increase
detected
in

is
especially
disturbing
because

george

an
epidemiologist
with
the
san

department
of
public
health
found
disturbing
rate
of
relapse
in
telephone
survey
of
gay
households
there
almost
one
in
five
men
said
they
had
had
intercourse
without
condom
in
the
past
year
even
among
those
men
who
had
made
commitment
never
again
to
engage
in
unprotected
sex
said
they
had
slipped
in
the
past
year
of
them
with
casual
partners
scientists
and
activists
say
they
are
alarmed
but
not
surprised
by
some
erosion
in

groups
in

health
crisis
of

city
called

specter
haunting
the

many
activists
explain
the
phenomenon
is
similar
to
the
experience
of
people
who
try
to
quit
smoking
drinking
or
overeating
slip
now
and
then
is
inevitable
but
falling
off
the
wagon
once
won
kill
you
says
san
francisco
activist
pierre
ludington
falling
off
the
safesex
wagon
can
risky
encounters
carry
an
especially
heavy
price
in
the
hardesthit
cities
like
san

where
half
of
the

estimated
gay

are
believed
to
carry
the
virus
still
given
human
nature
the
denial
of
risk
dies
hard
one
avowed
practitioner
of

recently
acknowledged
the
tragic
aftermath
of
single
lapse
in
letter
to
pat
christen
executive
director
of
the
san

aids
foundation
in
recent

on
the

read
excerpts
from
his
letter
am
one
of
the
people
you
are
talking
about
the
unidentified
man
wrote
practiced
only
safe
activities
since
was
not
infected
and
made
strong
commitment
to
stay
uninfected
unfortunately
several
months
ago
slipped
once
have
never
done
it
since
and
slipped
just
once
but
just
found
out
that
am
now
infected
with
the
aids
virus
he
added
hope
you
can
get
to
others
so
it
not
too
late
for
them
michael
demayo
of
the
gay
men
health
crisis
of
new
york
city
attributes
such
slippage
to
denial
low
selfesteem
and
alcohol
or
drug
use
also
he
says
that
after
years
of
decline
in
bathhouse
attendance
there
are
now
couple
underground
clubs
in
new
york
where
you
can
go
and
have
unsafe
sex
other
cities
also
report
resurgence
of
sex
clubs
although
some
are
said
to
enforce
condom
use

about
of

with
some
form
of
gonorrhea
though
that
lower
than
rates
of
the
early
mr
brooks
says
it
most
definitely
higher
than
we
like
to
see
in
seattle
hunter

director
of

county
health
department
says
that

gonorrhea
incidence
plunged
to
cases
in
from
cases
in

there
was
resurgence
in
when
cases
more
than
tripled
to
we
ve
seen
similar
rises
in
every
std
syphilis
herpes
genital
warts
and
chlamydia
all
in
gay
men
he
adds
we
have
no
other
rational
explanation
than
that
there
been
behavior
change
that
is
retreat
from
safe
sex
in
denver
which
had
seen
an
drop
in
venereal
diseases
there
also
small
increase
in
gonorrhea
in

says
gary
sky
of
the
colorado
aids
project
gays
who
have
been
practicing
safe

for
years
are
getting
tired
of
it
to
combat
relapse
the
colorado
project
has
published
pamphlet
on
how
to
negotiate
for
safe
sex
it
urges
people
to
tell
their
partners
no
condom
no
sex
it
also
reminds
those
already
infected
that
unsafe
sex
places
both
their
partner
and
themselves
at
risk
because
any
additional
assault
on
weakened
immune
system
can
accelerate
the
course

weary
explains

ron

of
the
university

san

having
succeeded
in
massive
behavior
modification
some
gay
men
found
it
as
hard
to
maintain
as
any
health
regimen
men
in
committed
relationships
sometimes
abandon
safeguards
in
the
interests
of
intimacy
he
adds
on
the
other
hand
younger
gay
men
in
their
early
s
who
were
boys
when
the
epidemic
struck
decade
ago
shun
condoms
because
they
see
aids
as
problem
of
the
older
leatherbar
generation
mr

is

illusion

at
the

of

the

that
opened
recently
at

maggie
smith
takes
the
stage
with
flair
and
an
authority
that
few
actresses
of
our
time
can
match
repeating
the
role
of
lettice
douffet
which
she
created
in
london
ms
smith
is
comedienne
at
the
top
of
her
form
when
lettice
and
lovage
opens
we
are
in
the
grand
hall
of
fustian
house
stately

home
in
wiltshire
operated
by
the
preservation

the
guide
who
meets
the
eager
tourists
as
they
arrive
is
lettice
douffet
the
only
problem
as
lettice
is
well
aware
is
that
fustian
house
is
the
dullest
house
in
england
with
year
history
during
which
absolutely
nothing
has
happened
initially
lettice
gives
the
unvarnished
history
of
the
staircase
in
the
grand
hall
but
it
is
rather
tedious
and
so
the
next
time
around
she
begins
to
embellish
queen
elizabeth
when
visiting
the
house
had
made
an
entrance
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
slipped
but
was
saved
by
the
owner
john
fustian
with
each
successive
lecture
the
story
gets
wilder
and
wilder
eventually
queen
elizabeth
trips
because
her
train
is
encrusted
with
hundreds
of
pearls
and
john
fustian
in
single
bound
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
catches
her
in
his
arms
as
reward
she
knights
him
on
the
spot
not
only
that
she
tears
five
pearls
from
her
train
to
be
embedded
in
the
handle
of
the
sword
she
presents
to
him
ms
smith
an
exceptionally
talented
performer
also
can
be
an
exasperatingly
flamboyant
one
here
however
her
impeccable
comic
timing
her
varied
vocal
deliveries
from
mock
surprise
to
deepthroated
declarations
to
nasal
ennui
and
her
sweeping
hand
gestures
are
perfect
for
the
character
at
the
end
of
one
of
lettice
more
extravagant
lectures
on
fustian
house
singularly
plain
woman
steps
forth
to
question
the
veracity
of
the
narrative
this
turns
out
to
be
lotte
schoen
supervisor
with
the
preservation
trust
who
has
had
numerous
complaints
about
the
excesses
of
lettice
performance
practical
literalminded
lotte
is
the
ideal
foil
for
lettice
especially
as
performed
by
margaret
tyzack
one
of
britain
most
accomplished
actresses
with
range
that
extends
from
inspired
classical
interpretations
with
the
national
theater
and
the
royal
shakespeare
company
to
memorable
film
and
television
roles
ms
tyzack
proves
her
mettle
as
comic
performer
here
scene
two
of
lettice
and
lovage
takes
place
in
lotte
london
office
where
lettice
has
been
called
to
show
cause
why
she
should
not
be
fired
rather
than
apologizing
for
her
actions
lettice
defends
them
appearing
in
an
elizabethan
long
cloak
and
wearing
hat
with
flowing
plume
she
says
that
she
has
enormous
respect
for
history
her
mother
was
shakespearean
actress
who
could
not
find
work
in
england
and
so
led
troupe
of
women
in
france
performing
shakespeare
in
french
but
always
the
history
plays
thus
lettice
has
double
heritage
history
and
the
theater
when
history
turns
out
not
to
be
dramatic
however
she
feels
it
her
duty
to
enliven
and
enhance
it
lotte
remains
unconvinced
and
lettice
is
fired
whereupon
ms
smith
magisterially
rises
from
her
chair
and
proceeds
to
reenact
the
role
of
mary
queen
of
scots
facing
her
executioner
journalistic
ethics
prohibit
revealing
the
exact
nature
of
her
reenactment
suffice
it
to
say
that
ms
smith
final
moments
afford
an
unforgettable
climax
to
the
act
lettice
and
lovage
is
by
playwright
peter
shaffer
whose
recent
plays
equus
and
amadeus
have
been
serious
but
who
returns
here
to
the
farce
form
he
employed
earlier
in
his
career
as
with
his
serious
work
the
theme
of
lettice
and
lovage
is
the
contrast
between
the
artistic
imaginative
free
spirit
personified
by
lettice
and
the
rational
earthbound
type
personality
exemplified
by
lotte
as
always
the
latter
finds
the
liberating
qualities
of
the
former
irresistible
having
fired
lettice
at
the
end
of
act
one
the
guiltridden
lotte
comes
to
visit
her
in
act
two
at
her
apartment
lettice
induces
lotte
to
try
her
renaissance
liqueur
concoction
that
includes
along
with
generous
portions
of
alcohol
an
aromatic
herb
called
lovage
not
surprisingly
lotte
loosens
up
and
under
the
influence
of
lettice
and
her
lovage
reveals
her
own
longdead
aspirations
she
had
once
wanted
to
be
an
architect
one
whose
mission
included
subversive
acts
against
the
monstrosities
of
modern
architecture
she
saw
rising
around
her
when
given
chance
however
to
sabotage
one
of
these
temples
of
mediocrity
she
had
failure
of
nerve
and
ended
up
in
her
bureaucratic
job
at
the
preservation
trust
mr
shaffer
having
maintained
firm
grip
on
the
comic
spirit
through
act
one
and
most
of
act
two
lets
it
slip
away
from
him
rather
seriously
in
act
three
when
the
actions
of
the
two
women
become
silly
he
develops
an
involved
farfetched
plot
that
has
his
heroines
engaged
in
mock
historical
executions
one
of
which
lands
lettice
in
court
with
lotte
scheduled
to
serve
as
witness
against
her
fortunately
the
comic
momentum
of
the
production
carries
us
through
this
lapse
and
we
come
away
remembering
the
exhilaration
of
the
earlier
scenes
and
the
artistry
of
ms
smith
and
ms
tyzack
added

british

found

protein
that
may
help
develop
the
first

for
alzheimer
disease
an
incurable
minddestroying
ailment
common
among
the
elderly
the
research
also
signifies
the
first
time
scientists
have
uncovered
possible
explanation
for
why
aluminum
builds
up
in
brain
cells
of
alzheimer
patients
aluminum
long
has
been
suspected
to
play
role
in
the
debilitating
neurological
disorder
which
afflicts
about
million
americans
and
kills
year
in
britain
about
people
suffer
from
the
disease
at
present
doctors
lack
clearcut
way
to
diagnose
the
illness
in
patient
except
by
eliminating
other
possible
causes
for
mental
deterioration
the
smallscale
study
suggests
aluminum
may
accumulate
in
brains
of
alzheimer
patients
because
they
have
defective
transferrin
blood
protein
to
which
aluminium
normally
binds
in
the
blood
stream
people
without
this
defect
would
be
protected
from
the
neurotoxic
effects
of
aluminum
concludes
the
report
in
this
week
issue
of
lancet
medical
journal
the
presence
of
the
defect
could
be
used
as
diagnostic
test
for
alzheimer
disease
adds
the
report
written
by
nine
british
and
french
researchers
paul
altmann
nephrologist
at
london
hospital
and
one
of
the
study
authors
said
the
research
is
quite
an
important
step
forward
in
understanding
alzheimer
disease
if
scientists
can
use
the
research
to
craft
simple
diagnostic
blood
test
he
added
it
opens
the
door
to
developing
the
therapeutic
maneuvers
in
the
future
but
these
are
things
that
will
take
some
time
to
develop
other
alzheimer
experts
were
even
more
cautious
the
finding
sounds
promising
but
great
deal
more
work
has
to
be
done
to
test
this
hypothesis
said
nora
graham
chairman
of
britain
alzheimer
disease
society
and
london
neurogeriatrician
john
candy
neuroscientist
at
england
newcastle
general
hospital
criticized
the
research
methodology
as
flawed
remain
skeptical
he
said
in
the
lancet
study
the
scientists
analyzed
blood
samples
from
individuals
divided
into
five
groups
control
group
plus
patients
undergoing
kidney
dialysis
and
patients
with
alzheimer
strokerelated
dementia
or
form
of
mental
retardation
called
down
syndrome
the
investigators
used
gallium
metal
similar
to
aluminum
to
measure
whether
aluminum
binding
to
transferrin
was
impaired
significant
impairment
showed
up
in
both
alzheimer
and
down
syndrome
patients
for
these
patients
the
amount
of
binding
to
transferrin
is
less
than
half
the
normal
amount
said
dr
altmann
transferrin
doesn
detoxify
the
metal
and
so
more
aluminum
apparently
slips
into
the
patients
brain
cells
this
whole
story
strengthens
the
evidence
for
aluminum
playing
role
in
alzheimer
disease
he
added
previous
research
has
found
aluminum
deposits
in
brain
cells
damaged
by
alzheimer
disease
and
down
syndrome
down
syndrome
patients
also
tend
to
develop
alzheimer
later
in
life
in
january
british
government
study
concluded
that
adults
who
consume
water
with
high
concentrations
of
aluminum
run
greater
risk
of
developing
alzheimer
disease
than
people
whose
water
contains
virtually
no
aluminum

patented
calcium

builds

in
children
according
to
study
funded
by
pamp
and
the
national

of
health
researchers
at
indiana
university
school
of
medicine
said
the
first
two
years
of
threeyear
study
on
the
calcium
supplement
show
that
adding
it
to
children
diets
could
help
them
avoid
bone
fractures
and
diseases
later
in
life
the
results
to
be
released
today
confirm
what
many
scientists
and
consumers
already
knew
calcium
builds
bones
but
this
research
shows
link
between
childhood
diets
and
bone
mass
marketers
are
skeptical
however
that
the
results
will
help

they
may
be
able
to
make

claims
about
their

but
it
not
like
they
re

besides
pamp
launched
its
calciumenriched
juices
three
years
ago
and
it
hasn
made
big

in

of
the

market
people
aren
enthralled
mr
pirko
said
the
study
funded
by
pamp
and
the
national
institutes
of
health
was
conducted
on
sets
of
identical
twins
from
five
to
years
old
testing
twins
eliminates
genetic
differences
and
helps
control
other
factors
like
environment
and
diet
each
twin
ate
daily
diet
containing
about
milligrams
of
calcium
one
twin
also
received
milligram
tablet
of
the
calcium
supplement
each
day
the
preliminary
results
show
substantial
improvements
in
bone
density
in
the
forearm
of
the
twin
receiving
the
supplement
precise
measures
of
the
improvement
weren
available
because
the
tests
will
continue
for
another
year
researchers
said
the
only
place
this
supplement
is
found
is
in
pamp
citrus
hill
plus
calcium
juices
to
get
the
same
dose
consumers
would
have
to
drink
three
sixounce
servings
day
previous
research
had
already
indicated
that
the
supplement
is
more
fully
absorbed
than
calcium
carbonate
common
calcium
supplement
said
judy
miller
associate
professor
of
medicine
at
indiana
university
calcium
is
calcium
she
said
but
this
supplement
makes
more
calcium
available
to
the
body
others
were
skeptical
of
the
supplement
impact
on
disease
such
as
osteoporosis
brittle
bone
disease
that
affects
about
million
people
in
the
children
that
get
supplemental
calcium
or
highcalcium
diet
regardless
of
the
source
will
end
up
with
denser
bones
said
james
simon
reproductive
endocrinologist
at
georgetown
university
any
extrapolation
on
the
risks
of
osteoporosis
later
in
life
is
unwarranted
pamp
officials
said
they
don
have
immediate
plans
to
launch
new
promotions
of
the
citrus
hill
products
or
to
introduce
new

by
