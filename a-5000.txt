   Earlier this month, the Journal brought together four economists to discuss whether income in America is becoming more unequal: Barry Bluestone, professor of political economy at the University of Massachusetts; Frank Levy, professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs; Fabian Linden, executive director of the Consumer Research Center of the Conference Board; and Richard Vedder, professor at Ohio University.

   WSJ: What is happening to income in America? 

   Bluestone: We see the following trends beginning in the early 1970s: first, stagnation if not an absolute decline in hourly wages, weekly earnings and average annual earnings; second, growing inequality in earnings, particularly among men; third, a growing proportion of the labor force earning lower wages, at least among full-time workers. 
There seems to have been very little reversal in any of those trends since the economic recovery beginning in 1983. 

   Levy: There's been a trend toward greater inequality in men's earnings in most of the post-World War II period -- it grows faster sometimes than other times, and that trend certainly has been there in the past decade. 
There is no particular trend one way or another in women's earnings. 

   If you look at family incomes, from the end of the Second World War to the late 1960s, family incomes grew moderately more equal. 
They grew sharply less equal in the early 1980s. 
Historically, inequality grows when you go into a recession and declines when you come out. 
But inequality today is greater than it was at the bottom of the recession. 

   When incomes are growing fast, inequality has less meaning because the poor are getting richer and the rich are getting richer even faster -- but everybody's better off. 
Because of the general stagnation of earnings this decade, that's not the case now. 
A relative decline means an absolute decline. 
The sharpest example is that if you look at workers in their late 20s and early 30s with a high school education, in the early 1970s they were averaging $22,000-$23,000 in today's dollars and today they are making $18,500. 

   And the last point is that there have been sharp changes in the kinds of families at the bottom of the distribution. 
In the 1960s, the bottom fifth of families contained maybe one-sixth of all kids; today it's one-quarter. 

   Linden: I don't think there's much debate that income has been growing much less rapidly than in the 1960s. 
But why is this going on? 
My view is that there have been monumental social and demographic changes in the country. 

   But it remains a fact that per-capita disposable income rose by a total of 82% between 1960 and 1987 -- and by 13% between 1980 and 1987. 
Per-capita disposable personal income rose by an annual rate of 1.8% from 1980 through 1987. 
At that rate, the standard of living of the average American doubles in 35 years. 
That's been our past trend, it is our current trend. 
When we survey young workers, they say they are doing considerably better than their parents were at their age. 
And they're right: On average, today's young have an income that is in real terms 50% higher than their parents' at the same age. 

   Vedder: From 1947 to 1967 economic growth reduced poverty; from 1967 to 1987 we see little if any decline in poverty even though there has been some economic growth. 
Why has economic growth not resulted in the continuation of the reduction in poverty? 
A decreasing proportion of the poor are working poor. 
Of the 7 million families that are poor, half don't contain a wage earner. 
Public policies are leading people to take options that consign them to poverty. 

   WSJ: Let's begin by considering individual earnings from labor. 
What's happening, and why? 

   Levy: Low wages among young high school graduates come from weak manufacturing employment. 
Manufacturing got clobbered in the recession, and then got the short end of the stick in the recovery because of the high dollar. 
Put aside the question of good jobs and bad jobs. 
Suppose you had a group of women and a large number went into secretarial positions. 
Suddenly you abolish half of those jobs. 
Women's average wages would fall, even if those vanished jobs weren't good jobs. 
In the '80s, a lot of young men without college educations had to scramble for any kind of job because the factories weren't hiring. 

   Bluestone: As it turns out, and I'm one of the proponents of the de-industrialization thesis, the shift in employment from goods production to services does not by itself explain the growth in inequality, because inequality is growing in all sectors. 
I think something is happening to educational criteria. 

   I went to a public high school in Detroit, and graduated in 1962. 
About half my class went on to college, half didn't. 
At my 10th and 20th class reunions, those who went on to college were making somewhat more than those who had not, but the gap wasn't enormous -- we were in Detroit, remember. 
But when the class of 1980 meets for its anniversary, I predict the gap will have grown enormously. 

   In goods production, college graduates earned 2.1 times as much as high school drop-outs in 1963. 
Today they earn 2.4 times as much. 
But the service economy is putting more and more of a premium on advanced education. 
So while college graduates in services earned 2.2 times as much as high school drop-outs in 1963, today they earn 3.5 times as much. 
There certainly is a relationship between the decline in manufacturing employment and the growth in inequality. 
But even more powerful, there has been a restructuring within industries. 

   Linden: But much of this is the impact of the baby boom generation. 
Within the prime age range of 25 to 54 -- when earnings are at their highest -- the proportion of the category accounted for by the younger, less well-paid cohort of 25- to 34-year-olds was 35% in 1970. 
In 1985, it was 44%. 

   Bluestone: But those are the same people who in the previous period of greater equality were even younger -- 16 to 24 -- and so they should have been lowering wage rates even more then. 

   Linden: But their participation in the labor force was very slight -- most of them were still in school. 

   Levy: The growth in inequality among younger workers is as important as the growth of inequality between younger and older workers, and between high school and college graduates. 
Inequality's grown a lot. 
The economy's in a lot of turbulence. 

   WSJ: Perhaps as the economy becomes more entrepreneurial -- as foreign competition mounts, as small business proliferates -- the price society is prepared to pay for talent is greater? 

   Linden: There was a period in which you could earn your bread by the sweat of your brow. 
Now, as the economy becomes more complex . . . 

   Bluestone: You have to use something above the brow. 

   Levy: The economy in the '50s and '60s was certainly not sclerotic, but the inequality in men's earnings was less than it is now. 
Compared to the early '70s, a larger proportion of men earns over $50,000 (in constant dollars) and a larger proportion earns under $20,000. 
But a smaller proportion is earning between $20,000 and $50,000. 
The top has increased because, if you want to put a good face on it, there is more recognition of talent, and if you want to put a bad face on it, because people feel less of a sense of restraint than they used to. 

   Markets are there all the time. 
But how much do you allow the full impact of the market to come to bear on wages, and how much do you dampen the market through custom? 
Certainly in the 1980s, we let more of the market be felt. 
If the minimum wage erodes through inflation, that's good. 
If you can get a really big salary by threatening to jump to another firm, even though it's nine times what your colleagues are making, go ahead, that's OK. 

   If you want to take it one step further, this may ultimately be traceable to the stagnation of earnings. 
When everybody is getting better off very fast, you may say, well, I've got mine. 
But when people get a little edgy about the future, there's more of a temptation to play for the short run. 

   Vedder: We all agree that the growth in earnings from work has slowed down dramatically since the mid-'70s. 
I won't agree to any specific numbers, because there are complex issues here -- fringe benefits, inflation deflators, the dates you use. 
But I don't think there's any question that the measures show some increase in inequality over the past 15 years. 

   Linden: Remember that the period from the end of the war to the 1960s was extraordinary. 
We had a depression and then a war in the 1930s and '40s, so there was a huge backlog of sophisticated technology that had not been implementedthere was a whole network of growth impetus. 

   Bluestone: But there's a whole series of institutional factors at work too. 
At one time in this country, we had more than a third of the labor force in unions -- in manufacturing, as much as 45%. 
By demanding raises in pennies per hour rather than in percentage terms, by fighting for promotion by seniority rather than pay for knowledge, unions have been a force for greater equality. 
With the demise of unions, you have a freer market in wages. 
A freer market has meant greater disparities. 
In 1988 the average chief executive of a Fortune 500 company earned 93 times as much as the average factory worker and 72 times as much as the average schoolteacher. 
In 1960, he made 41 times as much as a factory worker and 38 times as much as a teacher. 

   Levy: The big change was on the demand side. 
We know that manufacturing is very sensitive to recessions, and we also know that in this last recovery the high dollar was very hard on U.S. manufacturing. 
So you're suddenly taking a big chunk of the demand for less well-educated labor, and putting it into shock. 

   Linden: What you're saying is that we are having an economic episode, related to the fortunes of the dollar. 

   Levy: I would say . . . yes. 
But how long that episode lasts has a lot to do with public policy. 

   Linden: But an episode is nothing we have to be too desperately concerned about. 
It's painful to live through, but it will not continue. 

   Levy: But from the point of view of a young person, the question is, what are the chances that they're going to out-earn their parents? 
That depends on something I can't predict very well: productivity growth. 
A 30-year-old man today is pretty certainly making more than his father did when he was 30. 
The difference is, that the father saw pretty rapid wage growth for most of his career. 
For the son it's an open question. 
If you do simple projections, you will find that for the college-educated son of a college-educated father, the son will top out at about 4,000 or 5,000 constant dollars more than his father -- which isn't outstanding, but isn't bad. 
But for high school-educated sons of high school-educated fathers, at current projections, the son won't out-earn his father. 

   WSJ: What about college-educated sons of high school-educated fathers? 

   Levy: The proportion of high school graduates going on to college has stabilized at 50% since the early 1970s. 

   Linden: But in the generation of the fathers of the baby-boomers, only 25% went to college. 
That's one of the reasons that this notion of the baby-boomers not doing as well as their parents is nonsense. 
Of course, while they're doing better now, this is only a snapshot in time. 
Will they do better into the future? 
That's as unpredictable as tomorrow's GNP. 

   Vedder: From 1929 until 1968 we had an increase in equality combined with economic growth. 
Since 1968 we've had an increase of inequality along with some slowing of economic growth. 
But over the long run, that trend will probably reverse itself, even in the absence of public policy. 
What we should be worrying about are the very poor. 
We have not been terribly successful in eliminating poverty in the United States. 
That's where we should focus our attention. 

   WSJ: How important are racial and regional phenomena? 

   Vedder: The employment-to-population rate among blacks was higher in 1954 than it was in 1987: 58% vs. 56.8%. 
For whites, it rose: from 55.2% to 62.3%. 
I don't think anyone would seriously argue that it's because of increased racial discrimination. 
Part of the black decline does relate to things like changing skill requirements. 
But part of it relates to family structure, and to things that affect work effort, like public assistance. 

   Levy: Of course, for female-headed families earning less than $15,000, 60% are white. 

   Vedder: Maybe, but among unrelated individuals, inequality for whites has fallen. 
For blacks, it has risen. 
If you compare families, the GINI coefficient -- the technical measure of inequality -- has risen 68 basis points for blacks, and 40 for whites. 
And income disparity among blacks was greater than among whites to begin with. 

   Bluestone: While this is true among blacks, it's part of a general trend. 
The white high school graduate or drop-out isn't doing as well as 20 years ago either, in both relative and absolute terms. 

   Vedder: And for regions, reversing the recent history of the U.S., it's been the relatively high income states that had the highest growth rates in the 1980s. 

   Bluestone: In the six New England states, the proportion of the work force in low-wage jobs went down between 1979 and 1987. 
But everywhere else it went up. 
In the Midwest, it began rising in 1973 and exploded after 1979: from 12% to 15.4% In the South it went from 18% to 20%; in the West, from 12% to 15%. 

   Levy: But most of that decline is concentrated in the Middle West. 
If you take out the big industrial states, the high school/college gap in wage rates among young men hasn't changed a whole lot. 
And there's your story: Heavy industry is falling apart. 

   Linden: But autos and steel account for just 2% or 3% of total employment. 
We have lost vastly more industrial jobs in low-paying textile and apparel industries. 

   Levy: It isn't just autos and steel that are being removed when you take out those states. 

   Bluestone: And even for people in textiles, those jobs are better than the alternatives -- working as security guards, or janitors, or in warehouses, or frying hamburgers. 
And the benefits of course were much greater, even in the lower-wage manufacturing industries. 

   WSJ: Let's go beyond the individual earnings data. 
What's happening to total family income? 

   Levy: Income per worker really has slowed down. 
Family living standards haven't suffered as much, but that's because we now have two-income families with one kid instead of one-income families with three kids. 
And also because, even as male-earnings inequality has grown, female-income inequality has been unchanged. 

   Linden: In the lowest quintile of the family income distribution, single-parent families grew between 1970 and 1987 from 33% to 46% of the total family population. 
Over those 17 years, there was a 10% increase in the number of husband-wife families; while other families increased by 90%. 

   Of the total increase between 1970 and 1987 in households earning less than $15,000 55% were single individuals, 28% were female-headed families. 

   In the top quintile of families, there has been an extraordinary growth in the number of working wives. 
In 1970, some 50% of the families in the top fifth had working wives; in 1987, some 66%. 
The number of working wives in the top quintile increased by 70%. 

   How much do these pulls increase inequality? 
It's difficult to say. 
But these are not small changes. 
These are monumental changes because the baby boom was monumental. 
Just between 1980 and 1987, the total number of persons working went up by 6%. 

   Vedder: In real terms -- not in nominal terms -- in real terms, payments to individuals by the United States government went up from 152 billion 1982 dollars in 1970 to $405 billion in 1988. 
That has implications for all kinds of things, including family structure and work effort. 

   Among low-income Americans, there is a very significant negative tax in the form of new benefits that have appeared since the 1960s: Medicaid, food stamps, WIC benefits, that have impacted adversely on low-income Americans' participation in the labor force. 
At the upper end of the spectrum, meanwhile, labor force participation is increasing. 
Why? 
Partly because you have some impact when you cut the marginal tax rate from 70% to 28%. 

   Levy: But inequality in family incomes increases faster when you ignore wives' incomes. 
The two-income family exerts less of an equalizing force than it did 10 years ago, because it's more acceptable for the wives of high-income men to work than it used to be; but even so, if you ignored all wives' incomes, you'd have more, not less, inequality. 

   Inequality is certainly exacerbated by the growing number of female-headed families. 
The reason the number is growing is open to question: welfare, changes in the economy, in mores, God knows what. 

   From about 1967 to about 1974, the number of cases on the welfare rolls doubled. 
You'd be a fool not to attribute a good part of that doubling to the raising of benefits and the attachment of food stamps and Medicaid to welfare. 
But since 1975 the cash value of welfare has fallen off substantially-and the number of femaleheaded families continues to grow, just as it had grown in the early '60s before the benefits were raised. 

   More and more women are divorced or are having kids out of wedlock. 
How good the welfare programs are may determine how many will be on welfare as opposed to doing something else. 
But that's it. 

   ---

   Where They Agree: 

   1.
Average earnings per hour have not improved during the '80s, despite the economic recovery. 

   2.
By all the conventional statistical measures of inequality, the inequality of earnings among men has increased during the decade. 

   3.
Inequality of earnings among women has not. 

   4.
The composition of the poor has changed dramatically: The working poor and the elderly poor have declined as a share of the total. 
In their place is a rising share of female-headed, non-working households -- a majority of them white. 

   5.
Conventional statistical measures also show that inequality of family income has grown, though not so dramatically as inequality of male earnings. 

   Where They Disagree: 

   1.
Whether the increase in the inequality of male earnings is best explained demographically -- by the changing age structure of the population -- or by the changing nature of the American economy's demand for labor. 

   2.
Whether this increase in earnings inequality is going to be self-correcting. 

   3.
Whether the increase in family inequality can be explained demographically and socially -- the entry of women into the full-time labor force, the baby boom, the new composition of the poor -- or again by labor demand and institutional factors.

   Stocks That Soared in 1st Quarter
   Could Run Out of Gas by the Fall

   NEW YORK -- Will the first quarter's dream portfolio
become nightmare stocks by the fourth period?
   It could happen. Investors don't expect all of the first
quarter's winning industry groups to be still flying high at
year end. The ideal portfolio in the just-ended quarter was
full of growth stocks and some shares of companies whose
fortunes swing with the economy; stocks sensitive to interest
rates were notable by their absence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But things change, and the transformation from dream to
nightmare could begin this quarter. Economic-cycle stocks
could be vulnerable the rest of this year, some analysts say,
while certain financial stocks could rebound.
   Few forecasters are predicting a recession this year,
though the sharp rise in interest rates during the first
quarter could slow domestic demand. Exports also could slow
because the dollar has strengthened.
   "Sales and inflation figures are going to start to
moderate," predicts Michael Strauss, chief economist at UBS
Securities Inc. "Underlying growth in the economy should be
weaker in the second quarter." Overall growth in the second
half of the year could be less than 1.5%, says Mr. Strauss,
who expects the Federal Reserve to respond to slackening
growth by nudging short-term interest rates a bit lower
around mid-year.
   Slowing growth could test the courage of investors who
hoped that a reacceleration of the economy would continue to
boost cyclical shares.
   "We think there is enough uncertainty in the economic
growth outlook that as we move through the year people will
lose conviction in cyclicals," says David Rajala, vice
president at One Federal Asset Management. "The
`safety-first' theme will resurrect itself."
   In the first quarter, "safety" meant growth stocks.
Winning industry groups, such as semiconductors and software,
are full of companies generating strong earnings because of
their dominant franchises and unique products.
   Air freight was the quarter's hottest industry group with
a gain of 19.6%. Federal Express, one stock in that group,
advanced 21.8% last quarter, partially due to takeover rumors
but mainly because of price increases in the freight industry
that promise stronger earnings ahead.
   "The swing from price cutting to an environment of price
increases has put life in these stocks," says David Guthrie,
analyst at Morgan, Keegan &amp; Co.
   Storage Technology, the best-performing stock on the New
York Stock Exchange with a gain of 81.9%, has all the
characteristics of a first-quarter favorite.
   First, the company is slicing debt from its balance sheet.
Storage Technology issued six million shares last month to
help pay down $285 million in high-coupon debt.
   Second, the company has a product that makes it dominant
in the computer-tape library market, says Mark Morris,
analyst at Hanifen, Imhoff Inc. "They own the tape library
market with no real competitor," he adds.
   And, Storage Technology's earnings could grow 32% this
year to $1.86 a share, Mr. Morris estimates, an increase in
line with proven growth stocks.
   EMC Corp., the No. 2 gainer on the Big Board, has a strong
alliance with Storage Technology. But the maker of computer
memory products also has other hallmarks of a first-quarter
winner, such as a broad, diversified customer base and a
niche product. Moreover, Richard Egan, chief executive
officer, says EMC finished the quarter with little debt and a
lot of cash on the balance sheet.
   Investors choosing among the cyclical stocks looked for
companies that had dominant positions in their industry.
Fluor, a part of the heavy-construction industry group, which
rose 13.2% for a No.3-ranked increase, is a world-wide leader
in engineering and construction. Its shares rose 16.3% in the
quarter.
   Stocks in the construction, heavy machinery, industrial
technology and factory-equipment industry groups also
benefited during the quarter from perceptions of higher
investment in factory and infrastructure rebuilding in the
U.S. and around the world. The rise in these shares reflects
"a shift in the economy to capital spending" and away from
military spending and consumption, says Alan Dorsey, analyst
at Dillon Read.
   Some analysts say the direction of interest rates will
tell the stock market's story at the end of 1990. Their
near-term bet is that short-term rates will fall a bit while
long-term rates stay where they are or even rise. If that
happens, many of the shares of well-run savings-and-loan
associations and financing companies that can buy money
cheaply and lend it more expensively could benefit, according
to Nancy Spady, analyst at Morgan Stanley.
   But investors should venture cautiously into thrift
stocks, Ms. Spady says. "You really want to focus on the
single-family housing lenders," she says. She is recommending
three: H.F. Ahmanson, Great Western Financial and Golden West
Financial.
   Poor first-quarter performers included banks with suspect
loan portfolios, insurance companies with suspect bond
portfolios and highly leveraged companies of any type. But
some good companies were tarred, and investors are beginning
to differentiate the good financial stocks from the bad.
   "We have begun to purchase selected insurance stocks such
as General Re and Chubb," says William Kufta, senior vice
president at Pitcairn Financial Management. Mr. Kufta also is
"looking for values" and preparing to buy bank stocks. "We're
doing our best to identify the true risks in loan
portfolios," he adds.
   In another category, Joseph McAlinden, director of
research at Dillon Read, thinks basic materials stocks will
outperform the market in the months ahead. Last quarter, the
basic materials sector, which includes companies such as
Aluminum Co. of America and Union Carbide, lagged behind the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index of 704 stocks.
   "Companies that are sensitive to GNP {gross national
product, or a nation's total value of goods and services} can
be risky as we go into the second quarter," Mr. McAlinden
concedes. But he argues that companies have just about worked
off once-bloated raw materials inventories. Soon, they will
go back out into the market and start bidding up prices for
copper, aluminum and other essential industrial commodities,
he says.
   "You want to be emphasizing the materials companies now,"
he says, adding: "Amax in the aluminum stocks, and copper
stocks such as Phelps Dodge."
   What about the dollar's recent strength? Won't that make
U.S. basic materials producers less competitive?
   "It's not that you have had a strong dollar but a weak
yen," he says. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar is
not significantly higher, he asserts.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Stocks closed lower and ended the first quarter with the
lightest weekly volume in three months. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 20.49 to 2707.21.
   End-of-quarter buying from institutions seeking to round
out portfolios before reporting to clients wasn't sufficient
to offset the influence of a weak bond market and rounds of
futures-related sell programs. Broader market measures, which
lagged the Dow industrials through the quarter, didn't move
down as sharply Friday.
   For the first quarter, the Dow industrials posted a loss
of 45.99 points, or 1.7%, but managed a gain of 2.93 points,
or 0.1%, for the week. The S&amp;P 500 fell 3.8% during the
quarter, the New York Stock Exchange Composite lost 4.2% and
the Dow Jones Equity Market Index slid 4%.
   Motorola retreated 2 1/2 to 65 as 1.4 million shares
changed hands. The company was ordered to halt sales of one
of its biggest-selling chips as part of a judge's ruling in
its dispute with Hitachi over patent rights, which ended in a
draw. Hitachi lost 3 3/4 to 98 3/4; stocks of other Japanese
companies traded in the U.S. also fell in the wake of a
selloff on the Tokyo stock market.
   L.A. Gear rallied 1 3/8 to 38 7/8 on 1.6 million shares
after posting earnings for the fiscal quarter ended in
February that exceeded analysts' estimates. Net income surged
to 69 cents a share from 31 cents a year earlier.
   On the takeover front, Unocal rose 5/8 to 31 7/8 as 1.6
million shares changed hands amid renewed speculation about a

   Parent of the Department Store Units
   Of Campeau Files Under Chapter 11

   TORONTO -- The U.S. parent of Campeau Corp.'s department
store units filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in
what it said was a "procedural step" in the continuing
Chapter 11 reorganization of the retail units.
   Federated Stores Inc., formerly Campeau Corp. (U.S), said
it filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in San Francisco. That is the same court where three
Federated holding companies and a U.S. Campeau real estate
unit filed for Chapter 11 protection on Jan. 15.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Federated is the holding company for Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., which filed for Chapter
11 protection in Cincinnati on Jan. 15. It also holds two
U.S. real estate units and a joint-venture development
partnership with Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., a Youngstown,
Ohio, shopping mall developer that lent Campeau $480 million.
   Federated said its filing is "meaningless" to Federated
Department Stores and Allied Stores, and won't affect their
ability to meet their continuing obligations in the normal
course of business. It said the filing doesn't affect Ralphs
Grocery Co., Campeau's Southern California supermarket chain,
which isn't under Chapter 11 protection.
   Federated and Allied are receiving merchandise shipments
from 98% of their "key" vendors and their department store
inventories are on a par with year-earlier levels, said Allen
Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer, and James
Zimmerman, president, in a statement.
   A spokeswoman for Federated said she couldn't comment on
whether the bankruptcy filing would effectively freeze the
Campeau/DeBartolo mall development partnership. The
spokeswoman also said Federated's filing wasn't related to
the Canadian parent's latest cash woes.
   Campeau Corp. didn't pay about $18.9 million of interest
due last Saturday on two debenture issues, and for the second
straight month likely will skip a $5.2 million monthly
interest payment due today to two major creditors.
   Campeau said the debentures will be in default if the
payments aren't made by April 30, and it wants to defer
paying the interest until it has a new business plan for its
Canadian and U.S. real estate operations.
   Campeau is already in default on $705 million of loans
from Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. and DeBartolo because
it deliberately declined to pay February's $5.2 million
interest payment.
   A Campeau spokesman said it wouldn't be in the company's
best interest to pay the interest now. He said Campeau is
"pretty confident" the debenture holders will agree to defer
the payments. Approval of 66% of the debenture holders is
needed for such a deferral. He said the company is up to date
on paying interest due on other loans.
   Olympia &amp; York declined to comment, but a source close to
the real estate development concern closely held by Toronto's
Reichmann family said it probably would be amenable to
deferring payments. DeBartolo officials weren't available for
comment.
   Analysts weren't surprised by Campeau's decision to skip
the interest payments on its debentures.
   "It wasn't totally unexpected given the negotiations they
must get through with their creditors on debt owed by the
parent company," said Ross Cowan, of Toronto-based Levesque
Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.
   Analysts expect Campeau's business plan will include
renegotiated loan agreements and an accelerated program of
asset sales, including some of Campeau's prime properties
that are encumbered under loans.
   Campeau's debt crisis became acute when Federated and
Allied sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection. The
Canadian parent company needed the cash flow from Federated
and Allied to service debt taken on during its $6.6 billion
takeover of Federated in 1988.
   The interest payments Campeau missed Saturday include
about $13 million due on its $260 million of 7% convertible
debentures, all of which are held by Olympia &amp; York, and 6.9
million Canadian dollars (US$5.8 million) due on C$184
million of 7.5% convertible debentures, of which C$46.6
million is held by Olympia &amp; York. The interest rate on the
7% debentures was increased to 9.86% last September.

   VLSI to Post Profit

   For the First Quarter

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- VLSI Technology Inc.'s first-quarter earnings
should meet analysts' expectations, the company's chairman
and chief executive officer, Alfred J. Stein, said.
   "We expect to do as well as the analysts are projecting .
. . between five and eight cents a share," Mr. Stein added.
VLSI makes standard and customized integrated circuits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Stein noted that late last year, the company guided
analysts' first-quarter projections lower from earlier
estimates of around 15 cents a share.
   He said a slowdown in standard chip-set sales and a drop
in demand for custom chips by its largest customer, Apple
Computer Corp., stalled revenue growth in the quarter.
   The company had a loss of $6.3 million in the first
quarter of 1989, largely due to problems during the start-up
of its chip plant in San Antonio, Texas. VLSI earned 11 cents
a share in the latest fourth quarter.
   The company expects to release its first-quarter earnings
April 12.
   Mr. Stein said seasonal slowdown in Far Eastern demand for
the chip sets was partly responsible for damping growth in
the first quarter.
   The region's IBM-compatible computer makers use the sets
in personal computers that see their strongest sales before
the Christmas holidays. Far Eastern demand generally slacks
off in the first quarter, Mr. Stein said. Shipments to the
Far East account for about half of the company's chip-set
sales.
   Mr. Stein said demand for customized chips by Apple
Computer has recovered from a drop that also depressed
first-quarter revenue.
   "Apple is coming back very strongly to us," Mr. Stein
asserted. He added, however, that the impact of Apple's
resumed demand won't be felt until the second and third
quarters of this year.
   Apple accounted for 13% of VLSI's revenue in 1989, while
sales to International Business Machines Corp. rose to about
10% of total revenue.
   Mr. Stein said sales to IBM will exceed sales to Apple
this year because of increasing shipments to IBM, not because
of shrinking sales to Apple. The increasing importance of IBM
as a customer illustrates VLSI's strategic shift toward sales
of "application-specific standard product," primarily
standardized chip sets for personal computers, over the
customized chips designed for Apple Computer and others.

   Japan Air Lines

   Order Valued at $2 Billion
   Is for 10 MD-11s, Options
   On a Stretched Version

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. confirmed that it received an
order from Japan Air Lines Co. valued at about $2 billion for
10 of its MD-11 aircraft and options for 10 more that could
be converted into orders for a new stretched version of the
MD-11.
   Analysts said that McDonnell Douglas had been planning a
relatively simple variation on the wide-body, triple-engine
jet for a couple of years, but that now it appears to be
moving toward a more radically modified aircraft, the MD-12X,
which could involve a costly redesign of the wing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   JAL's interest in the bigger plane, which would seat
roughly 100 more passengers and compete with medium-range
versions of Boeing Co.'s 747 jetliner, gives the MD-12X a
"significant lift," said a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas's
commercial aircraft unit in Long Beach, Calif. "We expect to
have a business plan ready for approval by the board around
mid-year."
   St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas beat out Airbus
Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, for the JAL
contract. "After studying it (the two aircraft) from various
angles, we concluded that the MD-11 was the best buy," JAL
President Susumu Yamaji said at a press conference in Tokyo
on Friday. He didn't say specifically what tipped the
decision in McDonnell Douglas's favor.
   Mr. Yamaji denied that the decision to buy American rather
than European airplanes was a political move to deflect
tensions over Japan's $49 billion trade surplus with the U.S.
But analysts said the political element could not be
completely discounted. "(JAL's) reputation in the U.S. is
very important to them," one Tokyo analyst said.
   JAL, Japan's largest domestic and international airline,
said the MD-11s would be used to replace its current fleet of
16 DC-10 models. The purchase is part of the airline's plans
to add 20 medium-capacity jet aircraft to its fleet between
1993 and 1998. A decision on which engines will be installed
hasn't been reached. Delivery of the MD-11s is set to begin
in late 1993, McDonnell Douglas said.
   McDonnell Douglas said the JAL order brings to 340 the
total of firm orders and "other commitments" for the MD-11.
The jetliner, an updated version of the DC-10 model, made its
first flight test in January. "We're shooting for (Federal
Aviation Administration) certification in October, with
deliveries to begin soon thereafter," the company spokesman
said.
   McDonnell Douglas said that JAL may convert some of its
MD-11 options to MD-12X orders if the company launches the
proposed program by the end of the year. The MD-12X could
seat up to 441 passengers in a two-class configuration,
compared with 323 passengers in the MD-11, the spokesman
said. The MD-12X would have a range of about 5,600 miles,
versus 8,000 miles for the MD-11. McDonnell Douglas declined
to disclose any cost estimates for the proposed MD-12X.
   "If it needs new wings, which is almost certain, it would
be a formidable cost factor," said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The development
cost could be more than $2 billion, he estimates. That is
roughly triple the $700 million the company has said it will
spend on the MD-11, which uses essentially the same wings and
fuselage as the DC-10.
   Mr. Nisbet said the proposed MD-12X triple-engine jet
could be more fuel-efficient than the Boeing 747, which has
four engines, on trans-Atlantic and other medium-range
routes. The MD-12X wouldn't be able to carry enough fuel to
fly from the East Coast of the U.S. across the Pacific Ocean.
However, he cautioned that the plane is "more or less wishful
thinking" until the company has firm orders, prices and
delivery dates.

   World's Workers
   Are Uniting...
   For Capitalism

   Self-proclaimed progressives have held that the interests
of the poor are best served by socialism, and that it is only
because of capitalist manipulation and deception that workers
everywhere did not "unite and throw off their chains." That
theory has crashed into the brick wall of reality with the
recent elections in Nicaragua, East Germany and Hungary. In
each country, it was the working-class areas that most
emphatically rejected socialism and voted for free-market
parties.
   The first socialist country to throw Marxism into the
dustbin of history in fully free elections was Nicaragua in
February. It is true that UNO, the opposition coalition that
defeated the ruling Sandinista regime, was made up of 14
parties whose views ranged from free-market to far left. Its
economic platform, however, called for free markets and
privatization.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The election results published in Barricada, the
Sandinista newspaper, show the depth of the repudiation the
party suffered in areas it had long considered its own.
   As expected, the Sandinistas turned out their loyal voters
in the capital of Managua. Middle-class areas filled with
homes that had been confiscated for use by government
loyalists voted for the Sandinistas. Many of the city's poor
barrios, however, rejected them. "In Monsonor Lezcano, UNO
won two to one," Barricada reported mournfully. In working
class San Judas, a Sandinista stronghold, UNO nearly won. The
day after the vote, Reuters reported, barrio residents burned
the Sandinista flag in the streets.
   The isolated southern area along Nicaragua's Caribbean
coast is probably the poorest region in the country. It gave
UNO more than 60% of the vote, its second-highest result in
any region. By way of contrast, the Rio San Juan area
bordering Costa Rica, perhaps the richest in Nicaragua, gave
the Sandinistas 58% of the vote and their best showing.
   In the area where the most severe contra fighting took
place, around Matagalpa and Jinotega, the Sandinistas claimed
voters would give them a landslide victory to express their
outrage at the U.S.-backed contra war. Instead, UNO won 58%
of the vote, the Sandinistas only 36%.
   Nicaragua's results should have prompted Western observers
to question media reports from East Germany that claimed
voters wanted to retain large elements of socialism. Carl
Bernstein, writing in Time magazine in January, said he
"could hardly find any citizens who said they wanted a
reunified, single Germany." He reported that "they love their
country. The German Democratic Republic, not the Federal
Republic of the West. They believe in socialism. Still."
   Mr. Bernstein could file this amazing dispatch only
because his interviews were done in East Berlin, the one part
of East Germany that clearly resisted the free market tide in
favor of rapid unification. The reform Communist Party won
30% of the vote in Berlin and the leftish Social Democrats
(SPD) and Alliance 90 another 41%. In the rest of the
country, the parties of the left won only 36% of the vote.
The high Berlin vote for the left reflected the high number
of Communist Party functionaries, court intellectuals and
policemen in the capital.
   Some Western analysts have attributed the conservatives'
victory to their supposedly massive rural support, but the
results indicate otherwise. Conservatives ran behind the vote
for the parties of the left in the most rural regions of the
country.
   But the conservatives triumphed in the densely populated
industrial areas of Thuringia and Saxony, the prewar
heartland of German socialism. The left won only 26% of the
vote in the Dresden district, and in the soot-begrimed
industrial region of Karl Marx Stadt, only 29%. Erfurt, where
the Social Democratic Party issued its political program in
1891, gave the SPD only 19% of the vote.
   The Social Democrats did poorly in part because many
workers harbored bitter memories of the years during which
the West German Social Democrats cooperated with the
Communist regime of Erich Honecker. "As time went on, the SPD
came to identify helping East Germans with helping the
Communist Party," bricklayer Olaf Wohlleben told John Barnes
of the Detroit News. Overall, exit polls showed that 60% of
working-class voters plumped for the conservatives and what
West German pollster Wolfgang Hartenstein called West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's "petit bourgeois certainties."
   Support for those same values dominated Hungary's
elections last week. The two leading parties, Democratic
Forum and the Free Democrats, disagree only on how rapidly to
move to a market economy. Together they won nearly half the
vote. The Socialists and Communists won a total of 15% and
were swamped by the pro-market Free Democrats, even in the
poorer areas of Budapest.
   Despite this sweeping repudiation of socialism, it would
be an exaggeration to say a majority of people in these
countries have become convinced capitalists. People are
voting not only for a different political and economic
system, but also to make their societies less political. When
Lech Walesa visited the Journal last November, he was asked
what the Polish people wanted. "We want to rejoin the ranks
of normal societies," he said. "It isn't an issue of
ideology, it simply means we want a system where politics
isn't everything and people can live normal lives."
   Having lived in countries where every aspect of life from
university exams to child care was politicized, voters in
Eastern Europe and elsewhere are embracing a little-heralded
feature of the free society -- the freedom not to be obsessed
with political questions. They can instead immerse themselves
in family, career, church or self-improvement. In normal
societies people may forget about politics and concentrate on
the serious business of living. Socialism even in its most
benign form is a bureaucratic committee meeting that never
ends.

   Your March 13 article on James Brady says the former White
House press secretary "makes a poignant personal point" by
comparing the inconvenience of gun owners' facing waiting
periods with his own inconvenience and pain resulting from
the head wound caused by John Hinckley's bullet.
   The so-called "Brady Bill," however, would not have
stopped Hinckley's attack on President Reagan, and if it
becomes law it will not stop future assassins or other
gun-toting criminals. Despite your claims, Mr. Brady brings
no "new dimension" to the highly polarized debate on gun
control. Emotion has long been an ally of the falsehoods and
distortions that are the stock and trade of Mr. Brady's
wife's group, Handgun Control Inc.

   Gun-control schemes promoted by people ignorant about and
hostile to firearms may enjoy better prospects of passage
today than in the past, but they enjoy no greater chance of
affecting criminal violence. To develop regulations that
really would have an effect, lawmakers need to avoid the
battle between the NRA and HCI by seeking the support and
collaboration of honest gun owners for restrictions that
respect their own rights while targeting those who criminally
misuse firearms. The NRA and its membership would rally
behind such efforts, but they would not satisfy the
self-righteousness and cultural bigotry of the HCI crusaders.

   You say many U.S.-made assault weapons are exported to
drug lords in Colombia and elsewhere. The drug lords, in
fact, are not interested in U.S.-made semiautomatic arms, but
prefer full automatic weapons, which they easily purchase
from many sources in Europe and Asia or occasionally steal
from local police and military forces. I've spent much time
in these areas on legitimate business and am not speaking
from secondhand knowledge.
   This "Colombian drug lord" gambit is simply the latest of
a long line of cliches foisted on the public by the
gun-control crowd to achieve its purposes.

   While the NRA is a very efficient lobby in Congress, it is
second to none in its ability to inform its members of any
attempt to weaken constitutional rights. Not only does it
inform its members, but through media attention brought to
its tactics it also informs the public at large and allows
citizens to consider both sides of the issue before voting
their convictions. The politicians know this. They also know
it is rarely beneficial to be on the side of an issue
supported by the minority opinion.

   Medical Supply Firms Expected to Post
   Growth of 14% in First-Quarter Profit

   The nation's health-care companies are expected to finish
the first quarter in robust shape.
   Medical-supply firms are expected to report earnings
growth of about 14% on average, analysts said, even though
sales growth has remained at about 10% over the past two
quarters -- a reflection of the medical industry's efforts to
hold down expenditures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the industry may face the threat of an economic
slowdown in 1990, an occurence that analysts said could
prompt insurers to further intensify pressure on hospitals to
cut costs. But even then, analysts add, the effect might be
minimal on suppliers, which have managed to hold down their
prices in recent quarters.
   Among the medical-supply concerns, Abbott Laboratories is
expected to report 15% growth in first-quarter earnings.
Sales for the Abbott Park, Ill., medical supplier rose 11% in
the fourth quarter to $1.46 billion, topping an 8.3% rise the
previous quarter.
   Baxter International Inc. is expected to report a 14%
increase in net income, with per-share earnings of 39 cents,
up from 34 cents a year ago. The Deerfield, Ill., company is
"on the verge of a significant restructuring move" that may
include corporate staff cuts and the sale of assets, said
David J. Lothson, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
   A few companies aren't likely to share in the overall
bright outlook. C.R. Bard Inc. is expected to report a 58%
drop in earnings, to about 16 cents a share from 38 cents a
year earlier. Since last summer, the Murray Hill, N.J.,
company has had to pull three angioplasty catheters from the
market after the Food and Drug Administration raised
questions about their design. The company is awaiting
approval to reintroduce the products.
   Hospital-management companies, benefiting from
restructuring and stabilized admission rates, continue to
report strong earnings.
   Despite some softness in the market for adolescent
psychiatric services, Los Angeles-based National Medical
Enterprises Inc. yesterday reported net income of $62.7
million, or 77 cents a share for its third quarter, ended
Feb. 28, up from $49.4 million, or 67 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Humana Inc. reported earnings of $75.8 million, or 75
cents a share, for its second quarter, ended Feb. 28,
compared with $62.4 million, or 63 cents a share, in the
year-ago period. Analysts praised the Louisville, Ky., care
provider for securing a supply of patients for its hospitals
by boosting enrollment in its health maintenance
organizations.

   Grand Met Expects
   15% Profit Rise
   In Fiscal 1990

   MIAMI -- Grand Metropolitan PLC expects a 15% increase in
earnings per share in fiscal 1990 and believes that its U.S.
businesses will generate half its profits, Chairman Allen
Sheppard predicted.
   The forecast assumes a 5% inflation rate and 10% real
earnings growth, Mr. Sheppard said. In the year ended last
Sept. 30, the London-based food, retailing and drinks concern
posted per-share earnings of 55.6 pence, an 18.5% gain from
fiscal 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Sheppard made his prediction while addressing
analysts, primarily from Britain, who this week toured some
of Grand Met's U.S. properties, including Heublein
distillers, Pearle health services, Pillsbury food and the
Burger King fast-food chain.
   Contending that "we don't have any bad businesses," Mr.
Sheppard said Grand Met will concentrate near-term on
expanding Burger King and Pearle as "international
brandings," while developing "critical mass" for its food
businesses in Central Europe.
   "We're looking for a stable of international brands --
that's our strategy," Mr. Sheppard said, adding that Grand
Met also is searching for "another Pearle that everybody else
has missed in service retailing."
   Mr. Sheppard and Group Finance Director David Nash also
said they hope to have Grand Met American Depositary Receipts
listed on the New York Stock Exchange by September. ADRs are
receipts for shares of a foreign-based corporation, which
trade much like stock in the U.S.
   "If we list I'd like to be able to issue some stock," Mr.
Nash said, indicating a total offering of perhaps $100
million. He and other Grand Met executives told analysts they
would expect considerable demand for such an offering in the
U.S.
   Grand Met has received the first round of bids for its
U.S.-based Alpo Petfoods Inc. unit and is "in the middle of
conversations with a number of serious purchasers," the
company said.
   Grand Met recently put Alpo up for sale because its goal
of building it into a billion-dollar business seemed
unobtainable, said Ian Martin, chief executive of Grand Met's
food sector.
   Mr. Martin termed Alpo's recent entry into the cat-food
business "very successful." Although its market share is only
around 1%, he said would-be buyers have been "surprised at
the success" of the new business.
   Reviewing Grand Met's extensive retailing (licensed
restaurants) group in Europe, Mr. Sheppard acknowledged that
Grand Met had "misread" the eating-out market in the United
Kingdom but is "back on track now."
   As for overseas expansion of Pillsbury brands, Mr. Martin
said he foresees "significant" opportunities for Green Giant
vegetables and Haagen-Dazs premium ice cream. He said the
company is seriously considering building a Haagen-Dazs plant
somewhere in Europe.

   The Testament of Philly Lutaaya

   It's a clear, sunny day -- the latitude is tropical but
the altitude is lofty. Gathered in crisp uniforms on a green
lawn are a hundred or so students of Gayaza High School, "the
oldest girls' school in Uganda." The camera pans their
smoothly sculpted faces, each lovelier than the last, while
their angelic voices pour forth a song to welcome an honored
guest. In this image of pure yet exotic beauty, we glimpse
why the British once called Uganda "the pearl of Africa."
   It's an image I grew up with, although I have never been
to East Africa. When I was seven years old, my physician
father was persuaded, by a former patient who had gone to
Uganda to teach in an Anglican missionary school, to pay the
modest school fees of a boy from a mountain village who
otherwise would have been unable to continue his education.
Since the boy was my age, the two of us became pen pals, and
my personal tie to Uganda was formed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The obvious thing to say now is that my pen pal (whom I
have met twice, in this country) is still alive. Mention
Uganda nowadays, and people do not think of schoolgirls
singing on a hillside above Lake Victoria. On the contrary,
they think -- or try not to think -- of the devastating
horror of the past 20 years, as the northern-based armies of
Milton Obote and Idi Amin imposed a brutal and genocidal
tyranny on their longstanding southern rivals.
   The horror has abated since 1986, when the exiled leader
Yoweri Museveni seized the government and instituted a policy
of amnesty and national reconciliation. But now another
horror is loose in Uganda -- AIDS. While some epidemiologists
debate the theory that one of the AIDS viruses originated in
the area of the Ugandan-Tanzanian border, others are
(rightly) more concerned with fighting the disease, which,
according to some estimates, now infects 800,000 of 16
million Ugandans.
   Which brings us back to Gayaza, where the guest of honor
is not a visiting bishop or a distinguished alumna, but a
popular singer named Philly Bongoley Lutaaya, who is dying of
AIDS. Mr. Lutaaya's public announcement of his condition, and
his travels throughout Uganda to educate his people about
AIDS, is the subject of "Born in Africa," a special combined
edition of "Frontline" and "The AIDS Quarterly" airing
tomorrow (9-10:30 p.m. EST, on PBS; check local listings).
   In Africa, AIDS is called "Slim," for reasons that are
obvious when we look at Mr. Lutaaya. Frail as a reed and
unhealthily reddish in color (except for the purple welts on
his skin), he wears wraparound sunglasses to protect his eyes
while delivering his message to the students: "Let us do our
best to have a virus-free young generation. It's easy to
avoid getting the virus. I beseech you, please be careful in
the way you handle yourselves. We need you."
   The message seems simple enough, and certainly Mr. Lutaaya
(who died in December) is an eloquent messenger. Early in the
film, the doctor who had been treating Mr. Lutaaya in
Stockholm describes the severity of the infections, tumors
and foot sores that, in his view, already have doomed the
singer to a bedridden existence. Yet Mr. Lutaaya defies this
prognosis by getting up, recording what would become a hit
song about AIDS, and then making the arduous journey back to
Uganda.
   Yet the message gets more complicated as we follow Mr.
Lutaaya through an itinerary that includes a great many stops
besides Gayaza. Part of the fascination of this film (made by
the award-winning Canadian film makers Virginia Storring and
John Zaritskyis) is its vivid portrait of contemporary Africa
as a place where the incursion of the modern world is both a
blessing and a curse.
   While still in Kampala, Mr. Lutaaya attends a party in the
neighborhood bar where he got his start as a musician. Here
we are reminded of the extreme moral permissiveness that has
existed in urban Africa for the past several decades. This
particular gathering is a sober one, but it's clear that the
bar is usually a spot where the music jumps, the beer flows
and traditional sexual morality -- whether tribal, Christian
or Moslem -- falls by the wayside.
   Such "liberated" environments attract young, uprooted
people who tend to be malnourished and afflicted with various
maladies, including venereal diseases, that have gone
untreated since the collapse of the Ugandan health system in
the early 1970s. Most researchers agree that it is this
combination of unfettered sexual activity and poor health
that has caused AIDS to become a heterosexually transmitted
epidemic in Africa.
   Therefore, in the spirit of scientific reason, Mr. Lutaaya
tries to convince people in mosques, churches, remote
villages (including his own) and the depopulated "ghost
towns" along the Trans-African Highway that AIDS is a
public-health hazard, not the work of witchcraft or a
punishment sent by God. He tactfully explains how the virus
is transmitted, and urges his listeners not to shun or
mistreat its victims.
   Here the complications begin, however. By insisting on a
non-judgmental attitude, Mr. Lutaaya may be inadvertently
furthering the process of secularization that contributed to
the problem in the first place. Given the role of religious
differences in Uganda's civil strife, we understand why Mr.
Lutaaya disapproves when a group of youngsters presents him
with a song blaming "rebellious" and "promiscuous" people for
bringing AIDS into their village, where it now kills the
innocent.
   Yet Mr. Lutaaya is caught on the horns of a dilemma, and
he is hardly alone. Public-health officials and religious
leaders throughout Africa agree that the best weapon against
AIDS is a return to monogamy, or (in the case of Islam and
traditional religions) polygamy, as long as husbands and
wives both remain faithful. But the only way to restore these
moral codes is to strengthen belief, which is also the source
of superstition and intolerance.
   Can people adopt strict moral behavior without rendering
strict judgment on the behavior of others? In the West, where
AIDS may not reach epidemic levels, we can afford this kind
of pragmatic pseudosolution. For us, the horns of the age-old
dilemma of religious toleration have become comfortably
blunt. But the same cannot be said of Africa, as this film
ably demonstrates. The fascination, and the sorrow, of Africa
is that it is a place where all human problems show up with
the sharpness of a razor.

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- American Century Corp. said its
creditors committee approved in principle a modified
reorganization plan that would allow the company to emerge
from federal bankruptcy court proceedings by merging with
Houston-based Tescorp Inc.
   American Century said the board of Tescorp, which makes
and distributes oilfield products, also approved the merger
in principle. The reorganization plan would give Tescorp
shareholders almost 93% of American Century, which owned
Commerce Savings Association, a thrift that was placed in
federal conservatorship last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Recently modified terms call for American Century
debenture holders to receive 7.25% of the stock of the
reorganized company, changed from 5%. The plan also provides
for 700,000 shares of a new class of $5 par value convertible
preferred to be issued to debenture holders. Those holders
also would receive warrants to purchase a total of two
million common shares over three years at an initial exercise
price of $3.50 a share.
   Current American Century shareholders, meanwhile, would
get no shares; previously, they were allotted a 2.25% stake.
However, these holders would be given warrants to purchase a
total of 857,000 shares in the new company over a three-year
period for an initial exercise price of $3.50 a share,
American Century said.
   The merger and the reorganization plan remain subject to
approval by the bankruptcy court, American Century's
debenture holders and Tescorp shareholders.

   Kodak Is Seen
   Posting Net Fall
   For First Period

   Eastman Kodak Co., still ailing from lower profit margins
despite measures last year to cut costs, is expected to
report another quarter of reduced profit.
   Most analysts in the past two weeks have dropped
first-quarter earnings estimates to 50 cents a share for the
photographic, chemical and pharmaceutical concern. In the
year-ago period, Kodak earned $200 million, or 62 cents a
share, on sales of $3.9 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Our assumption was that there was going to be a snap back
of margins from cost savings," said analyst Alex B. Henderson
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. But "it's a continuation
of last year's difficulties."
   Kodak, which won't report its results until May 2, refuses
to comment on analysts' profit projections. But the company
has maintained that much of the cost-cutting measures taken
late last year won't bolster results until later this year.
"We've said all along that our restructuring will be felt in
the second half," a company spokesman said.
   Last August, after six-month net income slid 60%, Kodak
announced its fourth restructuring plan since 1983. Under the
latest plan, the company said it would divest itself of 20
businesses and eliminate about 5,000 jobs in the U.S. to
generate as much as $1 billion in cash flow this year.
   So far, the company has divested itself of its minilab
products and overhead projector business and closed its
professional videotape businesses, among others. The company
two weeks ago also sold its floppy disk unit, the largest
business yet to be sold under its restructuring effort.
Analysts estimate the unit was sold for about $200 million,
for an estimated pretax gain of $25 million.
   Most of the businesses sold or closed were in the
information systems group, which has been hurt by high
administrative costs. For 1989, the business group was barely
profitable, generating operating profit of $57 million before
charges on sales of $4.2 billion. Analysts foresee little
improvement in the group's business outlook this year.
   Moreover, sectors that had been strong, such as Kodak's
chemical group, are coming under greater pressure from the
weak economy. Operating profit is expected to fall 25% this
year.
   Adding to first-quarter woes has been the relative
strength of the dollar overseas, particularly in Japan.
Besides making Kodak exports more expensive in overseas
markets, the strong dollar also lowers foreign currency
earnings. Sales overseas represented about 43% of total sales
for Kodak last year.
   The company notes, however, that demand for consumer
photographic film -- Kodak's cash cow -- continues strong
despite the company's higher than normal price increase last
December. "Price increases have been accepted by the market,"
said analyst Donald Zwyer of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. He
estimates the price increase will contribute about half of
the sales gain in Kodak's imaging segment.

   Even the Kitchen Sink Will Be Collected
   In New Recycling Program in Colorado

   Recycling is hot. But since most municipal curbside
programs pick up only aluminum cans, newspapers and glass,
many experts have questioned whether recycling will ever
fulfill environmentalists' dream of solving America's
solid-waste crisis.
   But a new program kicking off this morning in the
Ken-Caryl Ranch section of Littleton, Colo., suggests that
recycling's potential may be far greater than generally
thought.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Ken-Caryl program will pick up approximately 35
different items found in, around, even on the house, with
more to be added after the program gets rolling. Included is
almost anything aluminum, such as foil, pie plates, TV dinner
trays, pots and pans, lawn chairs, storm doors, window frames
-- even siding, rain gutters and car radiators.
   "This program's unique," says Resource Recycling magazine
editor-in-chief Jerry Powell. "If it works, it will be copied
everywhere," predicts Gregory Lawler, aide to Gov. James
Florio of New Jersey, a state up to its eyeballs in garbage.
   The Littleton program also will pick up every shape and
color of glass, plus a large number of paper products,
including corrugated cardboard, grocery bags, writing and
computer paper, even the kids' colored notebook paper, along
with newspapers. Plastic, too, is on the menu, specifically
plastic grocery bags, soda bottles and milk jugs.
   Then there are, for the lack of a better description,
specialty items, such as brass faucets, stainless steel sinks
and counter tops, copper wire and tubing, plus lawnmower
casings.
   "I'm cleaning out my house," says Ken-Caryl resident Cathy
Johnson, who pushed for the comprehensive recycling program
along with several other residents. "I'm throwing out huge
balls of aluminum foil and even my old lawn chairs," she
says.
   The Ken-Caryl program has other advantages over most of
the U.S.'s 5,000 or so existing curbside recycling programs.
One is that homeowners won't be asked to sort their
recyclables -- a task that has been a real turn-off for some
-- but rather will only have to put everything into a giant,
14-gallon bin. (The big items can be put out separately.)
Pick-up will be once a week by Laidlaw Waste Systems Inc., a
unit of Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. of Canada., which will
have a compactor truck follow its regular garbage truck
through the 2,700-home community.
   Another advantage is cost. According to Tri-R Systems
Corp., a Denver-based recycling firm that will sort and sell
the recycled 35 items picked up by Laidlaw, the typical
curbside recycling program currently costs about $2.50 per
household per month. Of that amount, about 15 cents flows
back to the community from the revenue generated by the sale
of the recycled goods.
   By contrast, the Ken-Caryl program will generate about 25
cents to 40 cents per household back to the community,
according to Tri-R chairman and president David Powelson.
Moreover, the additional revenue will come from more reliable
metals markets, offsetting the wide price swings for
newspaper and glass that have recently hurt many municipal
programs.
   Mr. Powelson says that among the other items scheduled to
be added to the Ken-Caryl program are tin cans, junk mail and
polystyrene. The latter has been banned by some
municipalities, but Mr. Powelson says that since the Food and
Drug Administration recently agreed to let recycled
polystyrene be used for making egg cartons, Tri-R will soon
have a resale market for that plastic material.
   Still, there are some things most homeowners commonly
throw away that won't be picked up. Batteries and motor oil
are two of them. Mr. Powelson explains that because both are
listed as hazardous substances, picking them up "would be
like picking up asbestos."
   Another common throwaway, the telephone book, also isn't
on the list, even though telephone books have been singled
out by environmentalists for needlessly filling up scarce
landfill space. The problem, says Mr. Powelson, is that the
only market for old telephone books is a small market
overseas: Some countries use telephone-book pages to wrap
fruit.

   The Republican Party is internationalist and expansionary
militarily and economically; it is rigorously conservative,
if not to say reactionary, on social issues such as abortion,
school prayer, gun control, etc.; it is dedicated to the
pursuit of wealth through lower taxes and the absence of
regulation without any seeming concern for the appropriate
role of government. What does the Democratic Party stand for,
as an alternative to this program? It is exceedingly hard to
tell because the Democrats are not an opposition party. The
Democrats share power, they do not seek it. Seeking power
requires submitting alternatives to the voters and competing
for their allegiance; sharing power is an entirely different
role. The Democratic leaders in the Congress are men of
intellect and character, of decency and strength. But, they
are part of an existing power structure, almost a coalition
government with a Republican administration.

   Study Shows Anti-Inflammatory Drug
   Is Useful in Treating Spinal-Cord Injury

   WASHINGTON -- Damage from spinal-cord injuries, frequently
the cause of paralysis, can be significantly reduced by large
doses of a common generic drug administered shortly after an
accident, medical researchers reported.
   The finding represents a breakthrough in dealing with
injuries that afflict about 10,000 victims a year, mainly
young men hurt in auto accidents. Many end up spending their
lives in wheelchairs. Caring for victims of spinal-cord
injury costs the U.S. government about $4 billion a year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Until recently there was little doctors could do to lessen
the destruction of such injury, but researchers found that
large doses of methylprednisolone, a commonly used
anti-inflamatory drug, given within eight hours of a
spinal-cord injury, can limit damage.
   The study provides "significant evidence that neurological
deficits can be reduced if treated quickly," reported Michael
Bracken, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of
Medicine, one of the coordinators of the tests.
   He said the use of massive doses of methylprednisolone
shortly after the accident can, in some cases, mean the
difference between being able to use a walker and being
restricted to a wheelchair. In other cases, he said, patients
who might otherwise be paralyzed from the neck down might be
able to regain some use of their hands because of the new
therapy.
   The study, which featured clinical trials involving
treatment of 487 victims of spinal-cord injuries at 10
medical centers, was sponsored by the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National
Institutes of Health. Results will be published in the New
England Journal of Medicine next month.
   The tests compared 162 patients treated with
methylprednisolone; 154 who received naloxone, an
anti-narcotic addiction drug that tests had suggested might
hold promise for treating spinal-cord injuries; and 171
patients receiving a placebo. Six months after their
injuries, the patients treated with methylprednisolone showed
nearly 60% greater improvement in motor skills, and more than
twice the improvement in their ability to experience touch,
than patients on the placebo. Naloxone didn't turn out to be
an effective treatment.
   The key to success is applying massive doses of the drug
within eight hours of an accident, explained Phanor Perot,
chairman of the department of neurological surgery at the
Medical University of South Carolina, one of the centers
involved in the study. Doctors gave an initial dose of 30
milligrams of methylprednisolone for each kilogram (2.2
pounds) of body weight, followed by an infusion of 5.4
milligrams per kilogram per hour for 23 hours. The drugs were
administered intravenously.
   The drugs for this treatment cost about $300.
Methylprednisolone is made by a number of companies. Upjohn
Co. donated the amounts used in the institute's study, called
the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study.
   Spinal injuries rarely sever the spinal cord. Instead,
they trigger swelling and a series of chemical reactions that
over time damage nerve cells in the spinal cord.
Methylprednisolone arrests some of this disintegration.
Scientists don't know exactly how it works, but they believe
it improves the blood flow to the injured area and reduces
swelling. Scientists used methylprednisolone after animal
tests suggested that it might work on humans.
   The new therapy has been so successful that the
investigators recommended that doctors start using it to
treat spinal cord injuries. In addition, they suggested that
paramedics could be trained to administer the therapy.
   Dr. Perot said that the success of the methylprednisolone
therapy suggests that there may be other drugs that will
interrupt or slow the cell disintegration that damages spinal
cords in the hours following injuries. "We may need a whole
salad of drugs" to arrest the cell disintegration process, he
said.
   Another area of research is focusing on cell grafts and
regeneration to patch damaged nerve fibers. "Once you limit
the initial damage, the next phase is how to repair it,"
explained Barbara Bregman, a professor of anatomy at
Georgetown Univeristy Medical Center. However, she said that
progress in this area of research lags behind efforts to
limit spinal-cord damage.

   Digital Equipment Corp. plans to announce some new
engineering workstations tomorrow, but they won't surpass the
raw speed of the RS-6000 workstations unveiled by
International Business Machines Corp. in February.
   Digital is touting features of its new workstations other
than speed. Donald Gaubatz, group manager for workstations,
said that DEC's new products will have better graphics than
IBM and will fit on a desktop, unlike most rival workstations
that sit in consoles beside the desk.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nevertheless, "This announcement is less than one might
want," said Peter Kastner, an analyst with Aberdeen Group,
Boston.
   The workstation market has been a game of corporate
leapfrog in recent years as Digital, Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Hewlett-Packard Co. surpassed each other in producing the
latest "hot box." Digital's expected failure to top IBM shows
what a dramatic speed improvement IBM achieved when it
re-entered the market. The scientists, engineers and
programmers who use workstations demand fast machines to run
complex software and display detailed graphics.
   Digital has had a hard time in the market for fast
workstations that use reduced-instruction-set-computing, or
RISC, architecture and the UNIX operating system. Most of
Digital's workstation sales are VAXstations that run its
proprietary operating system.
   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that Digital's new
workstations will be based on Mips Computer Systems Inc.'s
R-3000 microprocessor. He said that Digital engineers have
coaxed performance of 24 million instructions per second, or
MIPS, an industry measure of performance. That far outspeeds
Digital's Decstation 2100 workstation, which processes 14
MIPS. But it falls short of IBM's new Powerstation 320, which
runs at 27 MIPS, and its more expensive Powerstation 530,
which runs at 34.5 MIPS.
   Analysts generally expect Digital to price its newest
model at less than $20,000, depending on features. Mr.
Gaubatz said the workstation will be competitively priced.
   Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities, said that
he thinks Digital's new workstation will run faster than
IBM's workstations in commercial applications, although it
will be slower for many scientific jobs involving heavy
computation.
   Digital entered the RISC-workstation market early last
year, breaking with tradition by buying a microprocessor
design from another company, Mips Computer, rather than
building its own design. Digital's goal was to get into the
market fast. However, analysts say that its entries, the
DECstation family, have gotten off to a slow start. Terry
Shannon, who follows Digital for International Data Corp.,
Framingham, Mass., estimates that Digital sold only about
6,000 of the DECstations last year compared with about 60,000
VAXstations.
   Domenic J. LaCava, Digital's vice president in charge of
workstations, noted that the DECstation sales are "all
incremental business," that otherwise would have gone to UNIX
competitors such as Sun Microsystems. But Digital's version
of UNIX is sufficiently different from others that many UNIX
programs have yet to be translated, or "ported" in industry
jargon, to the DECstations. Digital is pushing developers to
port their software.
   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that, "the first year was a
signal that Digital was serious about the UNIX market. The
features in the new product make up for all the shortfalls of
the current model."

   Separating Muj From Mobs

   It was a mountaintop in Afghanistan, and it was hot. My
two companions, clad in Nike running shoes and the
traditional "shalwar kameez" -- baggy cotton trousers covered
by a long flowing shirt -- spread out their prayer rug and
made their obeisance to Allah. I leaned up against a tree,
wiped the sweat-soaked dust from my eyes and stared at the
glory of the Afghan countryside.
   The men I was with were not fanatics. Though they spoke of
jihad (holy war), of martyrdom, of Islam, no one in their
company would mistake them for the frenzied mobs that rail
against Great Satan America from Tripoli to Tehran.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   My problem then was the same others covering the war have
had -- how to convey this difference to an American audience
within the confines of an op-ed piece. In "Soldiers of God:
With the Mujahidin in Afghanistan" (Houghton Mifflin, 258
pages, $19.95), Robert D. Kaplan puts it this way: "These
were not the sorts of perceptions that would have survived
the brutal reductions of the television camera, the narrow
boundaries of hard-news writing, or the quantifications of
the think-tank analysts in Washington and London."
   Mr. Kaplan, until recently a free-lance reporter based in
Athens, is also the author of "Surrender or Starve," a book
about the barbarous, government-manufactured famine in
Ethiopia, and his experience shows. Indeed, his admitted
hostility toward other manifestations of Islam makes his
appreciation of the Afghans all the more impressive.
   "(B)ecause Afghans harbored no political insecurities and
were more relaxed in their faith than Arabs or Iranians," he
writes, "Islam in Afghanistan manifested a certainty and
unintimidating dynamism that did not exist in Iran, Pakistan,
or any of the Arab countries I had visited."
   His combination of firsthand war experience inside
Afghanistan and extensive reporting out of Peshawar -- base
of the seven-party alliance -- makes him sensitive to
distinctions that often escaped even devoted promoters of the
muj, local shorthand for the freedom fighters. The Peshawar
crowd, often ridiculed the more Westernized mujahedeen, many
of whom had relatives in Britain and the U.S. The national
Islamic Front of Afghanistan, for example, was dubbed the
"Gucci muj" and compared unfavorably with more rustic
warriors. But "the fact that members of their families were
abroad meant that they had other options," writes Mr. Kaplan,
who wonders whether that makes their decision to stay and
fight all the more significant.
   Equally telling are his criticisms of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
the one fundamentalist party leader whose zealous struggle to
turn Afghanistan into a centrally controlled theocracy
recalls the Ayatollah Khomeini. Mr. Hekmatyar has long been
accused of killing more muj than Soviets, but that never
stopped a disproportionate share of U.S. aid from flowing
through Pakistan into Mr. Hekmatyar's coffers.
   Just last week, a report by the House Republican Task
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare wondered why
Mr. Hekmatyar's party's "fracticidal fighting against other
resistance groups, its close and growing cooperation with
both Tehran and Kabul, and its active participation in
anti-U.S. international terrorism" have had "little or no
effect on the delivery of CIA assistance."
   By contrast, there is Abdul Haq, the charismatic self-made
commander responsible for the Kabul area, who is often
unjustly lumped with Mr. Hekmatyar. Though no less devout,
Mr. Haq's vision of Afghanistan couldn't be more distinct: a
decentralized, traditional Afghanistan where local rulers
hold real power. His visit with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald
Reagan, moreover, is credited with Washington's decision to
provide the Afghans with the all-important Stinger missiles.
   "I told Mrs. Thatcher that my great-grandfather and his
father before him fought the British, who invaded Afghanistan
to keep the Russians out," remembers Mr. Haq. "So I asked
her: Now that the Russians have finally come, as the British
once feared, why are you so quiet?"
   Mr. Kaplan rounds out his story with nicely detailed
descriptions of the minor but no less colorful types drifting
through Peshawar. There is John Wellesley Gunston, the
British army officer turned photojournalist; Savik Shuster,
the Jewish refugee from Lithuania who reported on the war for
Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe; Koshiro Tanaka, a Japanese
wouldbe Rambo whose goal is to kill a Russian with his bare
hands. At the outset of the book, Mr. Kaplan dismisses many
of them as "war freaks." But it seems hardly fair for him to
blast the big-name press and the international organizations
for their reluctance to assume great risks and hardships in
covering Afghanistan, and then complain about the few hardy
souls who did rise, however imperfectly, to that challenge.
   But this is a quibble with an otherwise first-rate account
of the determined hillmen who shot the Brezhnev Doctrine full
of holes, setting the stage for the dramatic events now
unfolding in Eastern Europe. However harsh the muj could be
on the battlefield, moreover, they did it without the
terrorist attacks on civilians that characterize most wars of
national liberation these days. In the face of the most
powerful weaponry, the latest strategies and the most modern
equipment, the stubborn Afghans taught the world an age-old
lesson.
   As one of Mr. Kaplan's colleagues put it: "Had the
Russians read Kipling more carefully, they might never have
invaded Afghanistan."

   April's CD Buyers Face Lukewarm Yields

   It's April again -- one of the two biggest months of the
year for maturing certificates of deposit.
   Over the next four weeks, according to some estimates,
investors will have to decide what to do with well over $100
billion of maturing CDs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Financial institutions around the country have been
gearing up for the occasion, readying a slew of special
promotions like "rising rate" certificates of deposit,
no-penalty CDs and even cash bonuses in an effort to capture
some of that treasure-trove.
   But unlike last April, when fierce competition among
banks, thrifts and brokerage firms helped drive some CD
yields into double digits, investors hoping for eye-popping
deals will be disappointed. The highest yield they can
expect: about 9% at some banks in a few especially
competitive markets, mostly in New England.
   "The bloom is off the rose," says Robert K. Heady,
publisher of Bank Rate Monitor newsletter.
   Interest rates in general are more than a percentage point
lower than they were a year ago. And with a softer economy in
some parts of the country tempering loan demand, many banks
have less need to go out of their way to attract deposits.
The government bailout of the troubled thrift industry has
also helped reduce aggressive competition, by eliminating a
number of institutions using extra-high yields to attract
desperately needed funds.
   All that might be considered good news for the stock
market. After all, yields on one-year CDs are generally
around 8%, two full percentage points below the historical
return on stocks, which has averaged 10% annually over the
past 63 years.
   Typically, however, investors are very conservative with
the money they put into CDs. Most of them simply roll over
maturing certificates into new ones of the same maturity.
This month will probably be no exception.
   "Customers are more wary of the stock market right now and
are looking for safety," says Anne Nelson, senior vice
president of CoreStates Financial Corp. in Philadelphia.
   Cautious CD investors do have some alternatives, however.
Treasury bills and money-market mutual funds both offer
yields higher than the average CD. Six-month T-bills were
yielding 8.22% last week, and the interest is exempt from
state and local income taxes. (T-bills, however, require a
minimum investment of $10,000.) The average seven-day
compound yield on money funds is 7.98%, and some funds are
yielding more than 8.5%.
   CD yields are actually up a bit from earlier this year. In
part, that reflects a slight rise in the general level of
interest rates. Some institutions have also increased rates
in recent weeks to beat the competition, says Norberto Mehl,
chairman of Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information
service. "It's a classic picture in March and April," he
says.
   April is a big CD month for several reasons, such as tax
deadlines and investments in individual retirement accounts.
Also, some of the cash that fled the stock market after the
October 1987 crash moved into six-month CDs, which, along
with one-year CDs, are the most popular maturities among
individual investors. That interest rates reached five-year
highs last April only added to the horde of cash becoming
available for reinvestment this month.
   Some banks and thrifts are trying to smooth out the
deposit inflows with odd-term CDs. New York's Bowery Savings
of America, for example, is offering four-month and
nine-month CDs with an 8.33% yield that could go up if
interest rates rise.
   Promotions on more popular maturities vary. In New York,
Bank of New York is advertising a six-month CD "that can only
go in one direction." Its yield, currently 7.78%, is
guaranteed to rise with any increase in the benchmark prime
lending rate. In the Washington, D.C., area, Perpetual
Savings Bank permits one withdrawal during the term of its
one-year CD without the usual penalty. Investors can also add
funds during the year.
   Provident Savings Bank in Cincinnati advertises "Cash
Bonus CDs" that "pay cash plus high yields." Bonuses range
from $50, for a $5,000 two-year deposit, to $2,500, for
$100,000 deposited for five years. The important thing for
investors is comparing yields. "The consumer-investor has to
look (at what the banks) offer . . . and see what he's really
getting," says Mr. Heady of Bank Rate Monitor.
   Bank of New York's six-month CD, for instance, is just a
tiny bit higher than the national average of 7.72% and
slightly below the New York average of 7.81%. Provident's
advertised yields include the cash bonuses.
   Long-term CD yields are relatively more attractive than
they've been in the recent past, which may encourage some
depositors to trade in their six-month and one-year CDs. In
San Francisco, for instance, both Wells Fargo Bank and Bank
of America are offering 8.44% on five-year CDs, compared with
7.90% for six months. A year ago, yields peaked at the
one-year or two-year maturities. Last October, another big CD
rollover month, yields were relatively flat across the board,
at around 8%.
   Investors looking for higher-than-average CD yields may
want to check with major brokerage firms, which negotiate
rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell. At
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., for instance, an investor can get a
one-year CD yielding 8.25% or slightly more. The average
one-year broker-sold CD is currently yielding 8.14%. That
compares with an average of 7.91% at major banks surveyed by
Banxquote Money Markets.
   For the very highest yields, investors will have to seek
out individual banks offering special rates, because of local
factors. For instance, several banks in Boston, Providence,
R.I., and some other New England cities are offering one-year
CDs with 9% yields. "The whole outlook on banking is negative
in this area," says Edward D. McCarthy, a Providence
financial planner. "The negative psychology really works to
the saver's advantage."

   Rubbermaid Says
   First Quarter Net
   Rose About 13%

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)

</IN>
<LP>
   Rubbermaid Inc. will post first-quarter net income of
about $33 million, or 45 cents a share, up 13% from $29.3
million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier, Stanley C.
Gault, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
   The expected earnings increase reflects higher sales of
Rubbermaid's housewares and lower raw-materials costs, the
executive said in an interview.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gault said revenue in the quarter rose slightly from
$349 million in the 1989 first quarter. The revenue gains
would have been stronger, officials said, had Rubbermaid not
held back on its retail inventory-building due to concerns
about the economy. "We want merchandise to move through the
stores, not just get the numbers up," Mr. Gault said.
   In its core housewares division, orders from retailers
were "on the light side" during the early weeks of the
quarter but have improved, said Walter W. Williams, president
and chief operating officer.
   Despite some worries about the economy, Rubbermaid
continues its fast-paced rate of new product rollouts. The
company unveiled 187 new housewares and specialty products in
January, including a 50-item line of brooms and brushes.
   Rubbermaid is optimistic of fast growth in that category,
despite the mature state of the market. The reason: larger
retailers could choose to stock the Rubbermaid line instead
of buying a variety of products from numerous suppliers.
   Besides, Rubbermaid hopes to create more demand by
boosting its advertising and promotion spending on that
product line and others. "We want to further enhance our
image with the consumer," Mr. Gault said. Last year's
advertising and promotion budget was about 3.6% of sales, or
about $45 million.
   For 1990, that will increase slightly, although the
company officials didn't offer details. One factor is how
much Rubbermaid saves on its raw-material costs. The company
expects polyethylene prices to drop during the year as
suppliers add capacity to plastic plants.
   Rubbermaid's Little Tikes toy division is expected to post
sales gains of between 10% and 12% over the year-ago quarter,
Mr. Williams said. The division's new management is
considering how to expand that business.
   The company's commercial products business should show
"average growth" in the quarter after lagging behind in 1989,
Mr. Williams said. One factor is the cautious spending among
food-service companies and others.
   For all of 1990, Rubbermaid agrees with analysts' earnings
estimates of between $1.80 and $1.85 a share, Mr. Gault said,
with revenue for the year topping last year's $1.34 billion.
However, the revenue figure won't include about $70 million
in sales from the housewares business in Europe. Those sales
are now part of a joint venture that isn't consolidated in
Rubbermaid's income statement.
   Capital spending is expected to climb 17% to about $100
million in 1990. The increase will cover new product
introductions, equipment replacements and other improvements,
Mr. Williams said.
   During the year, Rubbermaid will focus on management
succession in anticipation of Mr. Gault's retirement in May
1991. Mr. Williams is expected to become chief executive. "I
won't be running the company, but I'll be around to talk
about things," said Mr. Gault, who will remain a board
member.

   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp in February
dropped 7.3% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
91% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 534,000 metric tons of
market pulp in the latest month, compared with 576,000 tons
in February 1989. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62
pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 91% operating rate in February was down from 99% in
January and 101% a year earlier. Operating rates can exceed
100% because some mills may operate for a limited period at
higher capacity than that for which they are rated.
   For the first two months of this year, Canadian mills
produced 1,180,000 metric tons of market pulp, a 4.5% decline
from 1,236,000 tons a year earlier. The industry operated at
95% of capacity in the first two months, down from 103% a
year earlier.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp.
   Total market shipments in January dropped 16% to 505,000
metric tons from 599,000 tons a year earlier. Shipments to
all markets were down.
   Market shipments for the first two months dropped 13% to
998,000 metric tons from 1,146,000 tons a year earlier.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of February were
541,000 metric tons, a 30-day supply, compared with 512,000
tons, a 28-day supply, at the end of January, and 327,000
tons, a 15-day supply, at the end of February 1989.

   BTR, Pursuing Its Takover Bid, Sues
   Norton for Canceling Annual Meeting

   LONDON -- BTR PLC said it filed suit in federal court in
Boston to have Norton Co.'s canceled annual meeting
reinstated for April 26.
   Norton, target of an unsolicited $1.64 billion bid by BTR,
a London-based international conglomerate, on Thursday
canceled its annual meeting and scheduled a special
shareholders' meeting for June 26. Norton, a Worcester,
Mass.-based chemical and abrasives maker, said it needed more
time to weigh alternatives to BTR's bid, which it also
rejected as inadequate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If we get the date reinstated, we'll start our proxy
fight quite soon," said John C. Cahill, BTR chief executive
officer, in a telephone interview. BTR had given Norton until
Friday to accept its offer or face a possible proxy fight.
But if the June 26 special meeting date were allowed to
stand, Mr. Cahill indicated, any proxy fight wouldn't begin
for some weeks.
   In arguing that the annual meeting should proceed April 26
as scheduled, BTR noted that Norton's corporate bylaws state
that the annual meeting be held on the fourth Thursday in
April and that "no change in the date of the annual meeting
of stockholders may be made within 60 days before the date
fixed in these bylaws."
   BTR contended that Norton's board has tried to get around
the bylaws "by `cancelling' the annual meeting and
resurrecting it in the form of a `special meeting,' " but
that such a change is "impermissible."
   In response to BTR's request for an expedited hearing on
the annual-meeting issue, the court scheduled a hearing for
April 6.
   BTR's suit also asks the court to declare null Norton's
shareholder-rights plan and to declare that certain
anti-takeover laws of the state of Massachusetts are
inapplicable in the Norton takeover fight.
   Norton said it would "vigorously oppose" the BTR suit, and
filed its own suit in federal court in Boston seeking to
enjoin BTR's tender offer and to stop BTR from soliciting
proxies. Norton charged that BTR has violated federal
securities laws by, among other things, failing to disclose
"its practice and pattern of closing or moving plants and
laying off workers after various acquisitions it has made."
   The BTR chief executive said Norton's rejection of the bid
"was a very weak response." He added: "Norton made no
reference to shareholder value, and there is no expectation
that Norton can do anything short-term or medium-term" to
improve the company's operating prospects.
   Mr. Cahill urged Norton's board to provide BTR and other
Norton holders with whatever information it used to conclude
that BTR's bid was inadequate. BTR owns a fractional stake in
Norton. Mr. Cahill noted that before BTR made its $75-a-share
bid last month, Norton's share price never had exceeded $64
in the company's 105-year history.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Norton closed at $73.50, down 37.5 cents.
   Mr. Cahill said he expected to meet Massachusetts Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry in Washington, D.C., this
week to try to defuse political opposition to BTR's bid. "We
want to sit down in a spirit of good will and explain the
benefits of the bid to Norton and to the city of
Worcester," Mr. Cahill said.
   He also said BTR would run Norton "as a free-standing,
independent company" using Norton's current management.
   He held out the possibility that BTR might make capital
investments in Norton. Norton's capital investments "went
flat in the last four years, and I don't know why," he said.
"Perhaps it was because of poor cash flow."

   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit of

added that unless American Continental takes action by July
1, the case would be dismissed with prejudice.

<TEXT>
   American Continental filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last April 13. The
government seized Lincoln Savings, of Irvine, Calif., the
next day. More than 23,000 investors claim they weren't
warned of the risks in buying uninsured junk bonds of Lincoln
Savings. They lost $200 million when the thrift failed.
   Judge Bilby precipitated the company's March 7 dismissal
motion when he barred American Continental from continuing to
pay attorneys to pursue the case. He said he feared that
attorneys' fees would use up the equity in American
Continental.
   James Feder, an attorney for American Continental, said it
wasn't clear whether the firm will attempt to refile or
reopen the suit. "We don't have the time and resources to
pursue this suit with the other litigation we have going," he
said.
   Government regulators have estimated that the Lincoln
failure may cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   American Continental had argued that top thrift regulators
regularly leaked information to the press that hurt the
survival possibilities of Lincoln Savings. Named as
defendants were M. Danny Wall, former director of the Office
of Thrift Supervision; Darrel W. Dochow, acting principal
supervisory agent for Lincoln, and William K. Black, general
counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in San Francisco.
   The defendants couldn't be reached for comment.

   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- Great Pacific Capital Ltd., a New
York investment concern owned by a Canadian financier, Jim
Pattison, said it raised to 11.13% its stake in Ipco Corp.'s
common shares outstanding from 9.37% last November.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Great
Pacific said it holds 563,600 Ipco shares, including 77,800
acquired between Jan. 30 and Tuesday, for $7.125 to $8.125
each. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Ipco shares closed at $7.75, down 25 cents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ipco operates a chain of about 250 Sterling Optical and
Ipco Optical stores in 20 U.S. states and Canada, which
generated earnings last year of about $453,000 on sales of
$123.9 million.
   Ipco officials weren't available to comment on the filing,
and a Great Pacific executive wouldn't elaborate. Great
Pacific said previously that it may buy additional Ipco
shares or "make a proposal with respect to a business
combination," among other things, depending on market
conditions and other factors.
   Mr. Pattison, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, has
various closely held companies that generate aggregate annual
sales of more than two billion Canadian dollars (US$1.71
billion). He formed Great Pacific in 1987 to search for U.S.
acquisitions.
   In a recent interview, Mr. Pattison said that he wants to
acquire U.S. assets to help diversify his holdings, and that
he is mainly interested in retail or consumer product
companies. "We're comfortable serving the public," he said.
Mr. Pattison's holdings include car dealerships, grocery
stores, and advertising and packaging companies.

   Thrift Agency Agrees
   To Postpone Naming
   Receiver for Franklin

   The Office of Thrift Supervision agreed to postpone the
appointment of a receiver for Franklin Savings Association of
Ottawa, Kan., pending the trial of a lawsuit challenging the
thrift office's dealings with Franklin.
   Franklin, in turn, agreed to withdraw its request for an
injunction that would have prohibited the OTS from appointing
a receiver and liquidating any of the thrift's $11.4 billion
in assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreements effectively forestalled a court ruling on
the constitutionality of M. Danny Wall's appointment as
director of the OTS.
   "We just didn't touch that issue and didn't have to," said
Judge Dale E. Saffels, who is presiding over Franklin's
lawsuit in federal court in Topeka, Kan.
   Franklin and a handful of other thrifts are seeking to
block certain OTS actions because, they argue, Mr. Wall
should have been appointed by President Bush rather than
Congress. The OTS is currently appealing a decision favoring
that argument in a lawsuit brought by Olympic Federal Savings
&amp; Loan Association of Berwyn, Ill. In a similar lawsuit
brought by Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association of Portland, Ore., the OTS won the first round
when Judge Helen J. Frye of Portland refused to block the
appointment of a receiver for the thrift. Benjamin Franklin
was placed in conservatorship on Feb. 21.
   Franklin Savings was placed in conservatorship Feb. 16
after the OTS forced the institution to immediately recognize
about $119 million in losses on futures positions it held as
a hedge against losses in its $10.26 billion portfolio of
mortgage-backed securities.
   Franklin filed suit against the OTS on March 12 and won an
order from Judge Saffels, temporarily barring the OTS from
appointing a receiver. The suit also challenges Mr. Wall's
appointment and the OTS's use of new thrift accounting rules
in determining whether the institution was in need of a
conservator. Judge Saffels scheduled the trial for June 25 in
Topeka.

   Bush's S&amp;L Nominee Faces Tough Fight
   In Senate After Admitting Past Drug Use

   WASHINGTON -- After squeaking through the Senate Banking
Committee, the Bush administration's nominee to be its top
savings-and-loan watchdog may be in for a tough fight on the
Senate floor following the disclosure of his drug use in the
early 1970s.
   The nomination of Timothy Ryan was approved 11-10 by the
committee and sent to the Senate floor Friday, the day after
committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) announced that
Mr. Ryan appeared to lack enough votes to win approval as the
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both Democrats and Republicans had expressed skepticism
about the nominee's lack of financial experience. If
confirmed, Mr. Ryan would take charge at a time of industry
crisis and record losses.
   The disclosure that Mr. Ryan, who was special counsel to
the Bush presidential campaign, tried marijuana and cocaine a
few times in the early 1970s, cast some new uncertainty on
the nomination. It has propelled the administration into high
gear to push for his approval in a full Senate vote, which
could occur Wednesday.
   Mr. Ryan disclosed the information to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation during its background check, and the Senate
Banking Committee had that information before voting and
before NBC News reported it Friday evening. "Prior to my
nomination, I disclosed both on my FBI forms and verbally to
the White House and Treasury and the FBI that early in the
1970s, I smoked marijuana on a few occasions and tried
cocaine once, perhaps twice," said his statement after the
NBC report. "I regret this mistake. I don't regret having
voluntarily disclosed this information."
   Treasury officials said Secretary Nicholas Brady
telephoned senators over the weekend to push for Mr. Ryan's
nomination. He had telephoned and visited many members of the
committee the morning of the panel's vote, as well. "We knew
about this issue because the nominee voluntarily disclosed
the information," Mr. Brady said. "We do not believe the
reported incident should deter the full Senate from acting
promptly and favorably on Mr. Ryan's nomination."
   Some Republicans agreed that such a long-ago and
short-lived brush with drugs shouldn't tarnish Mr. Ryan's
chances. "There's a whole generation that's coming up for
posts in this kind of circumstance," said Sen. John Warner
(R., Va.), who sponsored Mr. Ryan in the Banking Committee.
"We can't write off those persons who many years ago have
experimented with controlled substances."
   Some in the Senate said that negative votes on Mr. Ryan
would be more likely to stem from general dissatisfaction
with the rocky progress of the bailout law passed last August
than from the drug issue. Republican leaders, including
Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, have warned that the thrift crisis
could haunt the party in elections.
   Even those who supported him said it was better to have
someone in the post with little financial background than no
one at all. "He might not have been my choice," said Sen.
Phil Gramm (R., Texas). "But there's not a hell of a lot of
people lined up for this job."
   Mr. Ryan, a former Labor Department lawyer, received
unanimous endorsement Friday from the committee's
Republicans. Two Democrats, Sen. Terry Sanford of North
Carolina and Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, surprised the
committee by voting for Mr. Ryan.
   "I have vacillated both ways," Sen. Shelby told the
committee Friday. "If we were voting last night, I would have
voted against him." Sen. Sanford wasn't present for the vote
Friday, and cast his ballot by proxy. An aide said the
senator always had intended to support Mr. Ryan.
   He won the nomination despite protests from Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), who said that Mr. Ryan skirted ethics
requirements in several instances, such as when he served on
an advisory council to the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act at the same time he represented a business group
with interests in the issue. Mr. Ryan subsequently resigned
from the council, at the request of the Labor Department.
   The committee vote Friday was a blow to Sen. Riegle, in
the wake of his forecast. "That can happen in a situation
like this," he said after the vote. "I won't make a
prediction for the full Senate." He said he wouldn't comment
on the drug issue.
   A pending court case could affect the confirmation
proceedings. An appeals court decision, due April 11, could
throw into question the standing that the Office of Thrift
Supervision's current director has to seize insolvent savings
and loans and to do other work of the S&amp;L bailout. That
possibility more than anything else may make Mr. Ryan's
nomination likely to succeed.

   Japan's Steel Exports
   In February Declined
   20%, Sustaining Trend

   TOKYO -- Continuing a sustained trend, Japan's steel
exports in February declined 20% from a year earlier to 1.359
million metric tons, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation
said.
   In November 1988, steel exports showed a year-to-year gain
for the first time since August 1986, but they have fallen
steadily again since then. A metric ton is equal to about
2,204.62 pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest data followed drops of 22% in January and 24%
in December.
   Federation officials reiterated that Japanese steelmakers
have been preoccupied with efforts to meet strong domestic
demand that has been fueling sustained economic expansion.
Recent surveys have shown that demand for steel from major
domestic users such as auto makers, shipbuilders and
construction companies remains strong.
   "Demand in overseas markets . . . appears to be
diminishing," an official said. "Other countries are also
trying to diversify their sources of supply."
   Reversing a long string of declines, exports to the U.S.
rose 16% from a year earlier to 260,000 metric tons.
Officials said shipments of seamless pipe, often used for oil
drilling because of its strong resistance against pressure
and corrosion, were especially strong. These more than
doubled from the year-earlier levels. This may be an
indication, the officials said, that oil drilling has been
accelerating in the U.S.
   The officials also pointed out, though, that exports in
the year-earlier month, at about 225,000 metric tons, were
particularly small as a result of brisk demand in the
domestic market. This comparison made the pace of growth in
February 1990 look good, they said. In January 1989, for
example, steel exports to the U.S. were more than twice as
large as in February 1989, or about 560,000 tons.
   Steel exports to communist countries continued a
persistent, sharp fall. Shipments to the Soviet Union plunged
52% to 47,000 metric tons, while those to China tumbled 62%
to 134,000 tons. Officials said that China and the Soviet
Union have been hurt by foreign currency shortages, and that
this apparently is responsible for the relentless downturn.
Economic conditions in the two countries haven't generated
strong demand for steel, either, they said.
   Exports to South Korea and Taiwain also slumped, off 44%
to 89,000 metric tons and 34% to 114,000 tons, respectively.

   DALLAS -- A former shareholder of the defunct Southwest
Savings &amp; Loan Association of Abilene, Texas, agreed to plead
guilty to artificially inflating the thrift's net worth to
raise its lending limits.
   Raymond Foy Phillips, 54 years old, was a prime
beneficiary of the increase in Southwest's lending limits,
according to documents filed Friday in connection with his
plea agreement in Dallas federal court.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The defunct Abilene thrift, which is unrelated to
Southwest Savings Association of Dallas, had $162.5 million
in assets and negative regulatory capital of $202.7 million
in August 1988. Two months later, Southwest was sold with 10
other thrifts to the Adam Group, an owner of cable television
stations based in Bryan, Texas. The thrifts are now part of
Olney Savings Association.
   Mr. Phillips, who acquired a significant block of
Southwest stock in 1983, used several different company names
to borrow funds from the thrift for the purchase of 292 acres
of land in Houston, according to court documents.
   When Southwest reached its legal lending limits, based on
its net worth, Mr. Phillips agreed to purchase certain assets
of the thrift at inflated prices, allowing it to book false
profits and boost its net worth. In one instance, Southwest
lent Mr. Phillips $2.4 million to enable him to purchase its
own assets, according to court documents.
   Mr. Phillips, who is charged with conspiring to pump up
Southwest's net worth, is the first person to face criminal
charges in connection with the thrift's failure. He is
cooperating in further investigations by U.S. Justice
Department's Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.

   Valeo Sees a Period
   Of Consolidation
   In Wake of Expansion

   PARIS -- French auto parts maker Valeo S.A. is heading
into a period of consolidation after adding production
facilities and purchasing several companies in the U.S. and
Europe during 1989, Noel Goutard, chairman, said.
   "We invested the equivalent of 9.3% of revenue in 1989 --
about 1.8 billion francs ($315 million) -- on modernization,
new products and increasing capacity," he said, adding that
the company now has to work on improving productivity and
profitability of new operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Goutard was presenting the company's full results for
1989 to French financial analysts, following the release of
revenue and profit figures to the press Tuesday.
   Valeo, the No. 2 auto parts manufacturer in Europe after
West Germany's Robert Bosch G.m.b.H., recorded a 15% net
earnings rise last year to 936 million francs on revenue of
19.5 billion francs, up about 18% from 1988.
   Analysts said they were disappointed with the results,
concluding that net profit below one billion francs during a
relatively good year for the auto industry portended hard
times for Valeo in 1990, during which the global car market
is expected to shrink.
   Mr. Goutard said acquisitions and inflationary pressures
weighed on the balance sheet in 1989. New purchases included
engine cooling systems maker Delanair Ltd. of the U.K. and
Blackstone Corp. of the U.S., as well as auto electronics
concern G. Cartier Systemes S.A. of France.
   Mr. Goutard said the companies acquired haven't yet
contributed positively to Valeo's balance sheet. The
companies generally had poor results on their own, and it's
Valeo's task this year, through rationalization, to turn
these new units into strong performers.
   Regarding the inflation effect, which cut into sales, the
Valeo executive said, "We weren't able to raise prices at the
same pace as inflation" in most markets, reflecting sharp
stiff competition from foreign auto parts makers.
   He added that as part of the company's rationalization
plan, 15 factories will be closed in 1990, leading to a
decline of about 10% in Valeo's work force. The number of
employees reached 34,200 last year, with 19,200 located in
France and 15,000 abroad.
   Mr. Goutard said the plant closings primarily will involve
factories that don't fit in with the company's product focus.
As an example, he cited a plastic injection plant run by
Cartier Systemes.

   HALUVHIMBI, South Africa -- "No one is free when others
are oppressed," says a sticker welcoming visitors to the tiny
house on the mango forest's edge. Behind the slogan lives the
Rev. Zwo Nevhutalu, tall and rail-thin, a build suited to a
life on the run from the autocratic authorities here in the
black homeland of Venda.
   "We live like rabbits," he says. Two weeks earlier he was
scurrying through the thick bush, avoiding a roundup of the
leaders of a mass rally celebrating the release of black
nationalist Nelson Mandela from 27 years in prison. That was
followed by a weeklong strike of Venda teachers, magistrates
and civil servants and a surprising protest over working
conditions by the police in this homeland tucked away in the
remote northeast corner of South Africa. Now that his voice
of dissent against the repressive homeland government is part
of a bigger chorus, the Lutheran pastor feels safe to return
to his parish.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Even those people who have been hiding behind benches and
under beds are now coming out saying enough is enough," he
says.
   Since the government in Pretoria suddenly unbanned 60
opposition groups in February, including Mr. Mandela's
African National Congress, the peasants of Venda have poured
out of their mud huts with one basic demand: an immediate end
to the homeland system. That system is the grossest
manifestation of South Africa's zealous effort -- known as
grand apartheid -- to separate white from black.
   South Africa's political analysts call it a "revolution of
raised expectations." The political reforms, coming after
years of repression, have prompted black demands for an
overnight cleansing of the poisons of apartheid. Every day
brings new protests across the country. Teachers demonstrate
against the inferior black education system, township
residents march against high rents and community squalor,
prison warders strike over poor treatment and segregation in
the prison administration.
   The result has been a wave of unrest that threatens the
white government's efforts to begin power-sharing
negotiations with the black majority. Last week, police
opened fire on black protesters in the township of Sebokeng,
south of Johannesburg, killing nine and injuring more than
400. A few days later, the ANC indefinitely postponed the
opening round of talks with the government scheduled for
April 11.
   The unrest has been particularly acute in the 10 black
homelands. In KwaZulu, more than 200 people have died in
recent weeks during fighting between supporters of Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi's homeland government and ANC-allied
groups opposed to the homeland system. And in the four
homelands granted independence by South Africa (while
Pretoria treats them as sovereign states, the rest of the
world refuses to recognize them), the impoverished residents
are pushing to reincorporate the territories into South
Africa.
   In Ciskei, on the Indian Ocean coast, disgruntled
soldiers, favoring reincorporation, led a successful coup,
prompting several days of celebration and looting that left
dozens dead and injured. In Bophuthatswana, homeland police
opened fire on residents who angrily took to the streets
after the president said reincorporation would never happen
"in 100 years." In Venda, the recent wave of strikes and
protests has led President Frank Ravele to say he favors
negotiations on reincorporation. But his opponents say there
is nothing to negotiate; they want Mr. Ravele and his entire
government to resign.
   "If Ravele doesn't make an announcement soon, there will
be protests until he does," says Phanuel Mphaphuli, the local
representative of the South African Council of Churches,
which opposes homelands. Last week, Venda was rocked by three
bomb blasts. Though no one was hurt, one damaged the
Parliament building.
   The homelands pose a dilemma for Pretoria. President F.W.
de Klerk has taken bold steps toward ending apartheid, but as
long as the homelands remain, apartheid will be alive and
well. The monster, in effect, has turned on its creator.
While the government acknowledges that artificial geographic
segregation has failed, it is battling to control the tempo
of change and doesn't want to yield to street protest by
unceremoniously dumping its loyal homeland leaders. In future
black-white negotiations, Pretoria would like to have them on
its side.
   The idea of the homelands, conceived in the 1950s, was to
rid South Africa of black citizens. In a madly ambitious
scheme of social engineering, Pretoria divided the black
population into 10 tribal groups and then herded them into
separate "bantustans," each with its own government. A steady
stream of money from white South African taxpayers would make
sure they stayed put.
   But the plan failed miserably in practice. Many blacks,
despite forced removals, continued to flock to the urban
areas, where the white-run economy depends on their labor.
The homeland governments were derided as Pretoria's puppets.
The huge South African subsidies fostered rampant corruption.
Despite attractive tax schemes, most businessmen stayed away,
except for casino moguls and Taiwanese shoemakers. Instead of
viable states, the territories became cesspools of poverty
and shameful examples of the huge gap between white and black
living standards in South Africa.
   Heading east on Route 524, there is no sign alerting
travelers that they are leaving "white" South Africa and
entering Venda. But it is soon obvious. The mango trees, once
in neat groves, now grow wild; brick farmhouses are now mud
huts; the feeder roads are now dirt instead of concrete; the
roadside fruit stands are now auto repair shops.
   Cut off from the wealth of South Africa, most of the
500,000 Vendans rely on subsistence agriculture. The
government is a cabal of village chiefs, many of whom are
ill-educated. A couple of cabinet ministers have been
implicated in ritual murders. One allegedly buried a woman's
head in front of his house, hoping to derive some mystical
power. Repression of political opposition -- in particular
the outspoken Lutheran Church -- has been brutal.
   When Venda took its leave from South Africa in 1979,
following a dubious election in which the new government
received scant support, Tshenuwani Farisani, the dean of the
Lutheran Church in Venda, agreed to preach at the
independence festivities provided he could choose his own
sermon. He focused on the parable of the foolish man who
built his house on sand. Early the next morning his home was
raided, beginning several years of repeated detention and
torture.
   Today, Rev. Farisani is in the U.S., having left Venda in
1987 to seek medical treatment. But since then, his lonely
cry of protest has been rippling through the mango forests.
Now, hardly a day goes by when some section of the population
isn't protesting, be it against witchcraft or low salaries.
People move around proudly wearing ANC T-shirts. Even the
police salute protesters with clenched fists.
   "We must give thanks for what is happening now even before
we reach the day of freedom," says Rev. Nevhutalu. "Our
people aren't allowing themselves to be taken for granted
anymore."

   On Lithuania, Bush Must Juggle Support
   For Both Gorbachev, Self-Determination

   WASHINGTON -- For six months, George Bush has collected
victories in the Cold War without having to do much to earn
them. Communist regimes were toppled across Eastern Europe
without much help from the U.S.
   But now that Lithuania is seeking to carry the East bloc
self-determination movement inside the borders of the Soviet
Union, the president's job isn't so easy any more. Mr. Bush
has to struggle to sustain his two major foreign-policy
themes: support for the democratic surge in territories ruled
by Moscow, and cheerleading for Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, whose recent decrees appear aimed at preventing
the uprising from penetrating his borders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When Mr. Bush meets Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze at the White House in a few days, he has to find
a way to reconcile those two roles without appearing to sell
out little Lithuania.
   Last week, when a reporter tried to force the president's
hand by asking him how the U.S. would respond to a crackdown,
Mr. Bush reacted sharply. "Too hypothetical; stop right
there," the president barked. "I am not going to make an
answer to a hypothetical question of that nature. What
possible good could come from the president of the United
States, standing halfway around the world, speculating on
something that he doesn't want to see happen? I mean, I could
inadvertently cause something bad to happen."
   Eager to preserve warm relations with Mr. Gorbachev, the
U.S. administration has declined to recognize Lithuania's
declaration of independence, despite urgent requests from
Vilnius and a 40-year U.S. policy of refusing to recognize
the Soviet annexation of Lithuania and the other Baltic
republics. After a few days last week of expressing concern
about Soviet intimidation, the U.S. toned down its public
comments for fear of provoking trouble.
   And, even in private communications between Secretary of
State James Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze -- a face-to-face
meeting in Africa and a cable last week -- the U.S. has taken
great care to avoid spelling out what a crackdown in
Lithuania would cost Mr. Gorbachev in terms of relations with
the U.S.
   The president's own letter to Mr. Gorbachev late last week
appears to have been similarly careful. "The president's
message to President Gorbachev simply reaffirmed our position
as stated many times," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said. He added that it "clearly stated {the president's}
support and the American support for the aspirations of the
Lithuanian people for self-determination" -- a statement that
clearly isn't the same as backing the immediate independence
the Lithuanians have declared.
   Mr. Bush himself said the letter was sent because "I want
to be sure that the Soviets understand our position and
understand that we are not trying to make things difficult
for Lithuania or for the Soviet Union or anybody else."
   There are three major reasons for this caution. First,
administration officials are convinced Mr. Gorbachev will let
Lithuania go peacefully, so long as it can be done gradually,
on Moscow's terms. Second, they argue privately that the
politically inexperienced Lithuanian leaders erred by quickly
declaring independence, rather than entering talks with
Moscow under Soviet law.
   The president himself said recently: "There are certain
realities in life, the Lithuanians are well aware of them,
and they should talk, as they are, with the Soviet
officials."
   Finally, and most importantly, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker
privately admire Mikhail Gorbachev and are convinced they are
within a few months of concluding important business with him
-- a vast scaling down of Soviet military power, an agreement
to unite Germany on Western terms, and an opportunity to open
the U.S.S.R. to market-based investment.
   "We are so close to so much," says one very senior
official. "That's why we want to try to get this Lithuania
thing behind us."
   This is by far the touchiest moment for foreign policy in
the Bush presidency. If the conflict in Lithuania settles
down into negotiations without an armed crackdown, the
Bush-Baker approach will look brilliant. If not, the
president will be accused of selling out a small, budding
democracy to further big-power goals.

   Health:
   Recent Progress Against the Spread of AIDS
   Is Threatened by Relapse in Safe-Sex Practices
   ----

   After years of observing safe-sex practices that
dramatically reduced the spread of AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases, the gay community is experiencing a
relapse in its ranks, threatening recent health gains.
   Cases of venereal disease are rebounding at gay clinics in
Los Angeles, Seattle and Denver. More alarming, the rate of
new AIDS virus infections in Chicago has risen for the first
time in five years. While still below the 7.5% annual growth
rate of 1984, new infections within a study group doubled in
the year ended June 1989 to 2% from 1% a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   No one knows if the upturn will prove to be a temporary
blip or a new wave of the epidemic. Nor is it certain other
cities will follow Chicago. However, a rise in venereal
diseases like gonorrhea could presage an increase in acquired
immune deficiency syndrome infection, which takes months
longer to show up as a positive antibody test.
   "We've been able to change sexual behavior in the past
five years and drop the rate of {AIDS} infection fivefold,"
says Lawrence Kingsley, a University of Pittsburgh scientist
who heads the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, or MACS, which
is tracking the AIDS virus in 5,000 men in Baltimore,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. "But still we're left
with annual increases of 1% to 2%. This is unacceptable from
a public health point of view."
   Given a conservative estimate of five million to 10
million gay men in the U.S., Dr. Kingsley worries that even a
1% to 2% growth rate means 50,000 to 200,000 new infections
every year. "To me," he says, "that's staggering." The
Chicago increase, detected in a group of 1,100 men, is
especially disturbing because all MACS volunteers get
intensive AIDS education, he says. He fears other men at risk
"may be experiencing a higher rate of infection than our
men."
   George Lemp, an epidemiologist with the San Francisco
Department of Public Health, found a disturbing rate of
relapse in a telephone survey of 400 gay households there.
Almost one in five men (18%) said they had had intercourse
without a condom in the past year. Even among those men who
had made a commitment never again to engage in unprotected
sex, 16% said they had slipped in the past year, 12% of them
with casual partners.
   Scientists and activists say they are alarmed but not
surprised by some erosion in safe sex. Activist groups in
several major cities have met quietly to discuss educational
strategies to deal with relapse. One group, the Gay Men's
Health Crisis of New York City, called relapse "a specter
haunting the gay community."
   Many activists explain the phenomenon is similar to the
experience of people who try to quit smoking, drinking or
overeating. A slip now and then is inevitable. But "falling
off the wagon once won't kill you," says San Francisco
activist Pierre Ludington. "Falling off the safe-sex wagon
{can}."
   Risky encounters carry an especially heavy price in the
hardest-hit cities like San Francisco, where half of the
city's estimated 60,000 gay men are believed to carry the
virus. Still, given human nature, the denial of risk dies
hard.
   One avowed practitioner of safe sex recently acknowledged
the tragic aftermath of a single lapse in a letter to Pat
Christen, executive director of the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation. In a recent speech on the problem of relapse, Ms.
Christen read excerpts from his letter:
   "I am one of the people you are talking about," the
unidentified man wrote. "I practiced only safe activities
since 1987. I was not infected, and made a strong
{commitment} to stay uninfected. Unfortunately, several
months ago, I slipped once. . . . I have never done it since,
and I slipped just once, but I just found out that I am now
infected with the AIDS virus." He added, "I hope you can get
to others so it's not too late for them."
   Michael DeMayo of the Gay Men's Health Crisis of New York
City attributes such slippage to denial, low self-esteem and
alcohol or drug use. Also, he says that after years of
decline in bathhouse attendance, "there are now a couple
{underground clubs} in New York where you can go and have
unsafe sex." Other cities also report resurgence of sex
clubs, although some are said to enforce condom use.
   The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center
reports a rise in sexually transmitted diseases among its
clinic clients. Psychologist Scott Brooks of the Edmund
Edelman Health Center clinic says: "About 30% of our people
are being diagnosed with some form of gonorrhea." Though
that's lower than rates of the early 1980's, Mr. Brooks says,
"It's most definitely higher than we'd like to see."
   In Seattle, Hunter Handsfield, director of sexually
transmitted disease control for the Seattle-King County
Health Department, says that city's gonorrhea incidence
plunged to 33 cases in 1988 from 1,300 cases in 1982. But
there was a resurgence in 1989, when cases more than tripled
to 102.
   "We've seen similar rises in every STD -- syphilis,
herpes, genital warts and chlamydia -- all in gay men," he
adds. "We have no other rational explanation than that
there's been a behavior change," that is, a retreat from safe
sex.
   In Denver, which had seen an 80% drop in venereal
diseases, there's also "a small increase in gonorrhea in gay
men," says Gary Sky of the Colorado AIDS project. "Gays who
have been practicing safe sex for years are getting tired of
it."
   To combat relapse, the Colorado project has published a
pamphlet on how to "negotiate" for safe sex. It urges people
to tell their partners: "No condom, no sex." It also reminds
those already infected that unsafe sex places both their
partner and themselves at risk because any additional assault
on a weakened immune system can accelerate the course of
AIDS.
   Older gays, veterans of the epidemic, are "war weary,"
explains epidemiologist Ron Stall of the University of
California, San Francisco. Having succeeded in a massive
behavior modification, some gay men found it as hard to
maintain as any health regimen. Men in committed
relationships sometimes abandon safeguards in the interests
of intimacy, he adds.
   On the other hand, younger gay men in their early 20s --
who were boys when the epidemic struck a decade ago -- shun
condoms because they see AIDS as a problem of the older
"leather-bar" generation, Mr. Stall says, which is a fatal
illusion. He says if something isn't done, "I'm afraid we're
going to lose the next generation."
   Gabe Kruks of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community
Services Center says recent strides in AIDS therapy may have
given lapsers a false sense of security. "The epidemic isn't
over," he says. "It's not yet a chronic manageable illness."
   Samuel Broder, National Cancer Institute director and
developer of such drugs as AZT, DDC and DDI, cautions: "No
drug in existence, or even on the drawing boards, is better
than prevention."
   Advocacy groups suggest that education programs have been
hurt by their own success. AIDS control worked so well among
white gay professionals that it masked a lack of similar
success among minorities and young men in their teens and
20s. Funds need to be renewed, programs retargeted, they say.
   Education programs should stress continuation of safe sex,
promote role models of healthy intimacy and "eroticize safe
sex," they say, to make healthy practices desirable, not
merely antiseptic.
   Of course, sexual risk-taking isn't confined to gay men.
In a recent letter to the New England Journal of Medicine
headlined "Sex, Lies and HIV," two Southern California
scientists said a survey found Los Angeles area college
students admitted lying regularly about their intimate
histories to obtain sex. And the Rev. George Exoo, a gay
Episcopal priest in Charleston, S.C., says bisexual married
men frequent highway rest stops near his parish for
clandestine encounters. Activists urge that safe-sex messages
be written to reach everyone, not simply urban gays.
   Programs for young people should break through their sense
of immunity and immortality, activists add. "We have to
rethink our prevention efforts," Mr. Stall says. "Declaring
victory and abandoning the field is a recipe for disaster."

   Profit Gains for '89

   TOKYO -- Bridgestone Corp. and Sumitomo Rubber Industries
Ltd., two of Japan's major makers of tire and other rubber
products, reported strong gains in consolidated pretax
earnings for 1989.
   Bridgestone, the No. 1 tire producer, said its pretax
profit climbed 15% to 110.33 billion yen ($705.5 million)
from 95.56 billion yen in 1988. But net income plunged 76% to
9.644 billion yen, or 12.60 yen a share, from 39.96 billion
yen, or 55.73 yen a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A company official attributed the sharp fall to foreign
exchange losses amounting to 20.67 billion yen. While pretax
profits are measured at an exchange rate prevailing when each
overseas sale is made, the official explained, net is gauged
with the same currency rate at year end, thus often leading
to a sharp difference in pretax and after-tax earnings.
   Also dragging down net were large losses stemming from
rising corporate and resident taxes, and a sluggish
performance by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., a U.S. subsidiary
that the official said was saddled with heavy interest
burdens and increasing equipment investment.
   In the U.S., Bridgestone's sales fell conspicuously in the
fourth quarter, as the U.S. economy slowed down, the official
said. Unstable economic conditions in Latin America and
fierce sales competition in Europe hurt
Bridgestone/Firestone's international tire operations.
   But Bridgestone's overseas sales, accounting for 59% of
overall sales, surged 82% to 999.9 billion yen from 549.7
billion yen in 1988. In the domestic market, sales rose 7% to
689.1 billion yen from 641.6 billion yen, owing to the robust
domestic demand-led economic expansion.
   Sumitomo Rubber, Japan's third-largest tire maker,
reported a 15% rise in pretax profit to 12.69 billion yen
from 11.04 billion yen in 1988. Net rose 30% to 6.69 billion
yen, or 46.83 yen a share, from 5.16 billion yen, or 37.91
yen a share.
   Sales rose 8.1% to 478.61 billion yen from 442.8 billion
yen.
   A Sumitomo official said the favorable performance
resulted from robust domestic demand.
   Sales of tires totaled 376.24 billion yen, up 8.2% from
347.73 billion yen. Sporting goods sales rose 3.3% to 69.75
billion yen from 67.49 billion yen.
   Sumitomo's overseas performance, including Dunlop Tire
Corp. of the U.S., Dunlop France S.A., SP Tyres UK Ltd. and
SP Reifenwerke G.m.b.H. of West Germany, was relatively
sluggish, compared with that in Japan, where demand for new
and replacement tires was strong.

   To Sell Lease Unit
   To GE Subsidiary

   DALLAS -- Lomas Financial Corp. said it agreed to sell its
commercial leasing subsidiary to General Electric Co.'s
General Electric Capital Corp. for about $161 million.
   The price, which was far below the book value Lomas
assigned to the subsidiary as of June 30, 1989, or $324.2
million, underscored the erosion of Lomas's net worth since
it filed for federal bankruptcy-court protection last
September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Lomas officials hailed the development, saying that it
would allow the financial-services company to shed the
leasing unit's $1 billion of debt and $30.6 million of
preferred stock. "Although in terms of the recoupment of
equity it was not as high a price as we might have hoped, our
focus has remained on the fundamental objective" of slashing
debt, Chairman Jess Hay said in an interview.
   Mr. Hay said the sale will fulfill the company's goal,
formulated last April, of cutting its then $5.8 billion debt
load by 60% to 65% and focusing its operations on its core
mortgage operations. Debt will be reduced to about $2.3
billion if the sale is completed, he added.
   The low sale price wasn't unexpected. In its second
quarter ended Dec. 31, Lomas took a $125 million charge
against earnings to cover net losses it expected to incur by
selling its leasing unit, known as Ellco Leasing Corp., and
its life-insurance segment. Lomas said Ellco's book value is
now $164 million, reflecting a write-down of the unit's
intangible assets.
   Frank Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc., Little
Rock, Ark., had previously estimated that the unit would
bring between $150 million and $200 million. "Once you enter
bankruptcy, especially if you're a financial-services
company, individual units as a general rule tend to
deteriorate," he said.
   Lomas paid about $263.3 million in cash and stock to
acquire Ellco from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
U.S. in 1987. The unit, based in San Diego, employs about 300
people and leases computer equipment and other
high-technology office gear to large corporations throughout
the U.S.
   General Electric Capital Corp., a financial services unit
of Fairfield, Conn.-based GE, couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Sale of the Lomas unit would require approval from a
federal bankruptcy court in New York. Under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a company receives court protection
from creditors while it works out a plan to repay its debts.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Theater: Maggie Smith's Tour de Force
</HL>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11
</SO>
<LP>
   New York -- At the beginning of "Lettice and Lovage," the
comedy that opened recently at the Ethel Barrymore Theater,
Maggie Smith takes the stage with a flair and an authority
that few actresses of our time can match. Repeating the role
of Lettice Douffet, which she created in London, Ms. Smith is
a comedienne at the top of her form.
   When "Lettice and Lovage" opens we are in the Grand Hall
of Fustian House, a stately English home in Wiltshire
operated by the Preservation Trust. The guide who meets the
eager tourists as they arrive is Lettice Douffet; the only
problem, as Lettice is well aware, is that Fustian House is
the dullest house in England, with a 400-year history during
which absolutely nothing has happened. Initially Lettice
gives the unvarnished history of the staircase in the Grand
Hall, but it is rather tedious. And so the next time around
she begins to embellish. Queen Elizabeth I, when visiting the
house, had made an entrance at the top of the stairs and
slipped, but was saved by the owner, John Fustian.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With each successive lecture, the story gets wilder and
wilder. Eventually Queen Elizabeth trips because her train is
encrusted with hundreds of pearls, and John Fustian, in a
single bound from the foot of the stairs, catches her in his
arms. As a reward, she knights him on the spot; not only
that, she tears five pearls from her train to be embedded in
the handle of the sword she presents to him. Ms. Smith, an
exceptionally talented performer, also can be an
exasperatingly flamboyant one. Here, however, her impeccable
comic timing, her varied vocal deliveries -- from mock
surprise, to deep-throated declarations, to nasal ennui --
and her sweeping hand gestures are perfect for the character.
   At the end of one of Lettice's more extravagant lectures
on Fustian House, a singularly plain woman steps forth to
question the veracity of the narrative. This turns out to be
Lotte Schoen, a supervisor with the Preservation Trust who
has had numerous complaints about the excesses of Lettice's
performance. Practical, literal-minded Lotte is the ideal
foil for Lettice, especially as performed by Margaret Tyzack.
One of Britain's most accomplished actresses, with a range
that extends from inspired classical interpretations with the
National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company to
memorable film and television roles, Ms. Tyzack proves her
mettle as a comic performer here.
   Scene two of "Lettice and Lovage" takes place in Lotte's
London office, where Lettice has been called to show cause
why she should not be fired. Rather than apologizing for her
actions, Lettice defends them. Appearing in an Elizabethan
long cloak and wearing a hat with a flowing plume, she says
that she has enormous respect for history. Her mother was a
Shakespearean actress who could not find work in England and
so led a troupe of women in France, performing Shakespeare in
French, but always the history plays. Thus, Lettice has a
double heritage: history and the theater. When history turns
out not to be dramatic, however, she feels it her duty to
enliven and enhance it.
   Lotte remains unconvinced and Lettice is fired, whereupon
Ms. Smith magisterially rises from her chair and proceeds to
reenact the role of Mary Queen of Scots facing her
executioner. Journalistic ethics prohibit revealing the exact
nature of her reenactment; suffice it to say that Ms. Smith's
final moments afford an unforgettable climax to the act.
   "Lettice and Lovage" is by playwright Peter Shaffer, whose
recent plays, "Equus" and "Amadeus," have been serious, but
who returns here to the farce form he employed earlier in his
career. As with his serious work, the theme of "Lettice and
Lovage" is the contrast between the artistic, imaginative
free spirit, personified by Lettice, and the rational,
earthbound Type. A personality exemplified by Lotte. As
always, the latter finds the liberating qualities of the
former irresistible.
   Having fired Lettice at the end of act one, the
guilt-ridden Lotte comes to visit her in act two at her
apartment. Lettice induces Lotte to try her Renaissance
liqueur -- a concoction that includes, along with generous
portions of alcohol, an aromatic herb called lovage. Not
surprisingly, Lotte loosens up, and under the influence of
Lettice and her lovage reveals her own long-dead aspirations.
She had once wanted to be an architect, one whose mission
included subversive acts against the monstrosities of modern
architecture she saw rising around her. When given a chance,
however, to sabotage one of these temples of mediocrity, she
had a failure of nerve and ended up in her bureaucratic job
at the Preservation Trust.
   Mr. Shaffer, having maintained a firm grip on the comic
spirit through act one and most of act two, lets it slip away
from him rather seriously in act three, when the actions of
the two women become silly. He develops an involved,
far-fetched plot that has his heroines engaged in mock
historical executions, one of which lands Lettice in court
with Lotte scheduled to serve as a witness against her.
   Fortunately, the comic momentum of the production carries
us through this lapse and we come away remembering the
exhilaration of the earlier scenes and the artistry of Ms.
Smith and Ms. Tyzack. Added to this are excellent supporting
performances by Bette Henritze as a mousy secretary and
Paxton Whitehead as a pompous, befuddled lawyer, all adroitly
directed by Michael Blakemore.

   U.K. Study Finds
   Protein Linked
   With Alzheimer's

   LONDON -- A British study found a defective blood protein
that may help develop the first diagnostic test for
Alzheimer's disease, an incurable, mind-destroying ailment
common among the elderly.
   The research also signifies the first time scientists have
uncovered a possible explanation for why aluminum builds up
in brain cells of Alzheimer's patients. Aluminum long has
been suspected to play a role in the debilitating
neurological disorder, which afflicts about 2.5 million
Americans and kills 100,000 a year. In Britain, about 750,000
people suffer from the disease.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At present, doctors lack a clear-cut way to diagnose the
illness in a patient, except by eliminating other possible
causes for mental deterioration.
   The small-scale study suggests aluminum may accumulate in
brains of Alzheimer's patients because they have defective
transferrin, a blood protein to which aluminium normally
binds in the blood stream.
   "People without this defect would be protected from the
neurotoxic effects of aluminum," concludes the report in this
week's issue of Lancet, a U.K. medical journal. "The presence
of the defect could be used as a diagnostic test for
Alzheimer's disease," adds the report, written by nine
British and French researchers.
   Paul Altmann, a nephrologist at London Hospital and one of
the study's authors, said the research "is quite an important
step forward" in understanding Alzheimer's disease. If
scientists can use the research to craft a simple diagnostic
blood test, he added, "it opens the door to developing the
therapeutic maneuvers in the future. But these are things
that will take some time to develop."
   Other Alzheimer's experts were even more cautious. The
finding "sounds promising. But a great deal more work has to
be done to test this hypothesis," said Nora Graham, chairman
of Britain's Alzheimer's Disease Society and a London
neuro-geriatrician.
   John Candy, a neuro-scientist at England's Newcastle
General Hospital, criticized the research's methodology as
flawed. "I remain skeptical," he said.
   In the Lancet study, the scientists analyzed blood samples
from 62 individuals divided into five groups: a control
group, plus patients undergoing kidney dialysis and patients
with Alzheimer's, stroke-related dementia or a form of mental
retardation called Down's syndrome. The investigators used
gallium, a metal similar to aluminum, to measure whether
aluminum's binding to transferrin was impaired.
   Significant impairment showed up in both Alzheimer's and
Down's syndrome patients. For these patients, "the amount of
binding to transferrin is less than half the normal amount,"
said Dr. Altmann. Transferrin "doesn't detoxify the metal"
and so more aluminum apparently slips into the patients'
brain cells. "This whole story strengthens the evidence for
aluminum playing a role" in Alzheimer's disease, he added.
   Previous research has found aluminum deposits in brain
cells damaged by Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome.
Down's syndrome patients also tend to develop Alzheimer's
later in life. In January 1989, a British government study
concluded that adults who consume water with high
concentrations of aluminum run a 50% greater risk of
developing Alzheimer's disease than people whose water
contains virtually no aluminum.

   West German Plan
   On Mark Exchange
   Stirs Ire in East

   The Bundesbank's proposal for a 2-to-1 conversion rate for
East German marks into West German marks triggered an uproar
in East Germany.
   The recommendation by Bundesbank President Karl-Otto Poehl
at a meeting of European Community finance ministers and
central bank governors in Galway, Ireland, marked a retreat
from pledges made by West German leaders during recent East
German elections. Mr. Poehl said a 1-to-1 conversion rate
should be limited to a maximum 2,000 marks per East German
citizen. The rest of East German savings, debt and wages
would be converted at the rate of two East marks for one West
German mark. A West German mark has a value of 59 U.S. cents
at current exchange rates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Furious East Berlin officials warned that anything less
than a broadly implemented 1-for-1 rate would impoverish most
East German wage earners and even hinder the unification of
the two Germanys. Leaders of the major East German parties
joined together over the weekend to reject the plan, and East
German Premier Hans Modrow said in a newspaper interview the
proposal has already stirred widespread unrest in the East
German population. He insisted that West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and other Bonn officials had promised East German
savers a 1-for-1 rate in the run-up to East Germany's March
18 election, which resulted in a landside victory for
Bonn-supported conservatives.
   "The election result was the result of these promises, and
nothing else," Mr. Modrow declared. The head of the caretaker
government insisted that East Germans had interpreted the
promises as having a broad application, including wages.
   Mr. Modrow warned that Bonn would be held responsible for
any strikes or demonstrations that might result from the
apparent policy shift. Officials for the East German
Christian Democrats reported that their East Berlin
headquarters was flooded with calls from angry citizens.
   Rainer Eppelmann, head of the Democratic Awakening party,
one of the three East German parties making up the CDU-led
conservative alliance, predicted a fresh wave of emigration
to West Germany.
   The proposal unsettled Mr. Kohl's allies back in Bonn.
Otto Lambsdorff, head of the Free Democratic Party, the
junior partner in the Bonn government coalition, told a
newspaper the proposal could be seen as "a breach of faith."
   East Germans can now buy West German marks at a subsidized
rate of one for each three East marks. Monetary officials
calculate the East mark's true purchasing power suggests a
rate of 4.4 to one. Even a 2-to-1 rate would be a vast
improvement for East German workers, they say.
   While the West German government hasn't accepted the
2-for-1 proposal, Finance Minister Theo Waigel said it was
"economically and financially well founded" and that it
couldn't be ignored, while Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann called the recommendation an "important decision"
that wouldn't inflict economic harm on East Germans.
   While unpopular among the populace, a 2-for-1 rate would
be a boon to highly indebted East German state companies,
which wouldn't have to use as much hard currency to pay off
debts, and would make East German companies more competitive
with Western ones. Such a rate would also be less
inflationary.

   At New York News
   Threat of Strike
   Is Looming Larger

   NEW YORK -- The threat of a strike at the troubled New
York Daily News looms larger than ever following the
expiration on Friday of a contract covering the 10 unions at
the country's largest metropolitan daily newspaper.
   Both Daily News management and union leaders remain at the
bargaining table. However, after months of bitter verbal
attacks by both sides, there's no sign of a truce. Observers
of the negotiations say the Daily News, which is owned by
Chicago-based Tribune Co., could face a walkout by union
members within a month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The industry's most acrimonious newspaper labor battle in
years comes at a bad time for the Daily News, which has
posted losses for most of the last decade. It faces increased
competition from another tabloid, Times Mirror Co.'s New York
Newsday, at a time when the New York advertising market is
the softest in years.
   Almost every scenario the Daily News faces is a dire one,
at least for the near future. Management has demanded major
cost and work concessions from the unions and says it is
prepared to publish and distribute the paper in the event of
a strike. Even so, the Daily News stands to lose significant
advertising and circulation.
   Union leaders say they hope to avoid a strike, yet several
of the unions have voted strike authorizations. Many workers
face the loss of their jobs permanently if they do walk off
their jobs. If there is a strike, the unions threaten to lead
a boycott of the paper by readers and advertisers.
   The 1980s nearly ruined the Daily News and strained
Tribune Co.'s commitment to publishing in New York. The Daily
News had revenue of $420 million in 1989, yet the paper was
only marginally profitable. Over the past decade, the paper
has lost $115 million on $4 billion in revenue. Average daily
paid circulation has fallen by 400,000 copies since 1979; as
of Sept. 30, 1989, the paper's circulation was 1.2 million,
down 7% from 1988.
   The union is charging mismanagement, and claims the
Tribune intends to win concessions, then sell off the
newspaper. James Hoge, publisher of the Daily News, is "a
sociable guy, but as a publisher he's a 4 on a scale of 1 to
10," said George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing
Trades Council. "The News has bum management."
   Daily News executives blame the heavy financial burden of
a bloated union work force. About 50% of the paper's revenue
goes to cover employee compensation, compared with 25% to 30%
at most other major metropolitan papers.
   As for selling the paper, media analysts doubt it will
take place. "New York is the biggest media market in the U.S.
The Tribune won't give that up," said Peter Appert, analyst
at C.J. Lawrence. "If they can get even a mediocre profit
from that huge base of revenues, it's worth pursuing."
   The troubling situation is a familiar one for Tribune Co.
In 1985, at the company's flagship Chicago Tribune, the
pressmen and printers unions were broken in a prolonged and
violent strike. The Tribune management won control of hiring
and eliminated costly labor abuses. The Daily News is looking
for the same and Mr. Hoge claims that with concessions in
hand, the Tribune will invest $500 million in new presses
able to print color pages.

   Calcium Supplement in Some P&amp;G Juices
   Strengthens Children's Bones, Study Says

   A patented calcium supplement found in some Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. juices builds bone density in children, according
to a study funded by P&amp;G and the National Institutes of
Health.
   Researchers at Indiana University's School of Medicine
said the first two years of a three-year study on the calcium
supplement show that adding it to children's diets could help
them avoid bone fractures and diseases later in life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results, to be released today, confirm what many
scientists and consumers already knew: calcium builds bones.
But this research shows a link between childhood diets and
bone mass.
   Marketers are skeptical, however, that the results will
help the consumer products giant's Citrus Hill brand juices,
which trail in third place in market share behind Minute Maid
and Tropicana.
   "This won't set the world on fire," said Michael Bellas,
president of Beverage Marketing Corp. Added Tom Pirko,
president of Bevmark Inc., a management consulting firm:
"They may be able to make more claims about their juice, but
it's not like they're rediscovering oat bran."
   Besides, P&amp;G launched its calcium-enriched juices three
years ago and it hasn't made a big difference in P&amp;G's share
of the juice market. "People aren't enthralled," Mr. Pirko
said.
   The study, funded by P&amp;G and the National Institutes of
Health, was conducted on 50 sets of identical twins, from
five to 14 years old. Testing twins eliminates genetic
differences and helps control other factors, like environment
and diet.
   Each twin ate a daily diet containing about 900 milligrams
of calcium. One twin also received a 1,000 milligram tablet
of the calcium supplement each day. The preliminary results
show substantial improvements in bone density in the forearm
of the twin receiving the supplement. Precise measures of the
improvement weren't available because the tests will continue
for another year, researchers said.
   The only place this supplement is found is in P&amp;G's Citrus
Hill Plus Calcium juices. To get the same dose, consumers
would have to drink three, six-ounce servings a day.
   Previous research had already indicated that the
supplement is more fully absorbed than calcium carbonate, a
common calcium supplement, said Judy Z. Miller, associate
professor of medicine at Indiana University.
   "Calcium is calcium," she said. "But this supplement makes
more calcium available to the body."
   Others were skeptical of the supplement's impact on
disease, such as osteoporosis, a brittle bone disease that
affects about 20 million people in the U.S. "Children that
get supplemental calcium or a high-calcium diet, regardless
of the source, will end up with denser bones," said James
Simon, a reproductive endocrinologist at Georgetown
University. "Any extrapolation on the risks of osteoporosis
{later in life} is unwarranted."
   P&amp;G officials said they don't have immediate plans to
launch new promotions of the Citrus Hill products or to
introduce new products containing the supplement.

RETAILING (RET)
</IN>
<LP>
   You've shopped till you dropped. But where do you put it
all when you get it home?
   The solution is to shop a little more, according to a
growing group of retailers who specialize in so-called
organization materials, items designed to tidy every inch of
the home and office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Organizing stores are sprouting in upscale shopping areas
in California and along the East Coast, and some retailers
have expanded nationwide via direct-mail catalogs. Most
target affluent consumers by emphasizing efficiency and time
management, as well as home and hearth.
   The businesses feed off demographic and cultural shifts
that are likely to shape the 1990s. Women who cleaned up
after the family a generation ago are out working. The number
of households is increasing as average household size
shrinks, meaning more but smaller residences. And as a
society, Americans are probably the most acquisitive people
in history.
   "We're in an accumulation mode that knows no bounds," says
Stephanie Culp, an organizing consultant and a founding
member of the National Association of Professional
Organizers. "So people find themselves in a terrible space
crunch."
   Hold Everything, a retail and catalog seller of organizing
goods, plans an ambitious national expansion this year. Kent
C. Larson, president of Williams-Sonoma Inc., the San
Francisco kitchenware merchant that owns the business,
attributes the boom in part to soaring real estate prices and
a tendency for people to entertain and relax at home. Hold
Everything, which started as a small catalog in 1982, plans
to open stores in New York, Washington and other Eastern
cities to complement its expanding chain in the West.
   The nascent organizing business is also taking advantage
of a retailing shift. Much of what they stock is designed to
complement personal computers, electronic entertainment
components and other modern inventions. But other goods are
low-tech housekeeping staples from the 1940s and 1950s, such
as coated wire cupboard shelves and sweater drying racks --
items once found in department store notions sections, dry
goods stores and five-and-dime stores, which have virtually
died out in many areas of the country.
   Maynard Hale Lyndon and Lu Wendel Lyndon, architectural
design specialists, say much has changed since they founded
the Placewares chain in Boston in 1977. Consumers are more
interested in recycling and efficient use of resources, Mr.
Lyndon says, and American manufacturers are finally producing
quality products once exclusively designed in Europe.
Placewares, which just opened it seventh New England store,
also sells via catalog and is planning further growth.
   Lillian Vernon Corp., the specialty catalog concern,
reports that some of its longtime storage and organization
items such as newspaper racks and recycling aids have
suddenly surged in popularity.
   Although the organizing business doesn't have any firm
statistics of its own, the National Housewares Manufacturers
Association says the general categories of bath, laundry,
closet and storage wares in 1988 accounted for about 4.6% of
the $35.2 billion of housewares sales, or a total of about
$1.62 billion.
   An organizing store's inventory generally includes
kitchen, utility room, bathroom, garage and home office
items, and occasionally furniture and tableware as well. But
some, such as Organizer's Paradise in Los Angeles, take an
even broader approach, pitching their stores as stylish
outlets where shoppers can buy anything from modular cupboard
organizers to a $4,000 electric blue ultrasuede swing settee.
"There was a real void in the market for upscale products,"
says Sandy Chism, who along with her daughter, Christi, runs
three stores in the fashionable Westwood, Beverly Hills and
West Hollywood areas.
   Merchants who haven't organized their own business plans
in the new field may find a closet full of problems --
pricing being a big one. Many organization stores offer such
sticker-shock inducers as $25 plastic sock storage boxes and
$8 assortments of decorative paper clips.
   Home-improvement stores, hardware stores and discount
stores are beginning to stock more organizing items, often at
prices that specialty stores can't match. The specialty
stores figure they can overcome the price gap by offering
higher quality and better selection and focusing on smaller
organizing niches.
   As with any new retailing concept, experts note, targeting
the right customers can be crucial to success.
   "A retailer is going to have higher sales and faster
{merchandise turnover} if the focus is on one area," says
Marcia Aaron, a specialty retail analyst with Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco. By moving too far into other
areas such as furniture or other housewares, retailers can
dilute their customer base.
   Ms. Aaron says the organizing and storage market has been
underserved up to now. "But there are a lot of people trying
to get in," she says. "And eventually, some will have to pull
out because it's just too competitive."
   Retailers say it can be a challenge to make people see a
need for organization wares. "Most people just don't go
around thinking, `I really need a laundry-room organizer,'"
says a sales clerk at a Los Angeles-area store. "But once you
get them in here, you can't get them out."
   Many shoppers agree. "You get caught up," says Mara
Slutsky of Boston, a customer at Placewares. She bought a
shower organizer and colored hooks for the bathroom, and says
she had to restrain herself from buying "everything
imaginable."
   Ms. Slutsky's only criticism of the merchandise is a
common one among several firms' customers: "After a while,
everything looks alike," she says of the sleek,
modern-looking wares. Nonetheless, she says, she plans
another shopping spree when she moves to a new apartment.
   Lori Lavin, a West Los Angeles resident, gushes over the
merchandise in a new 13,000-square-foot Organizer's Paradise
store as she wheels a wire shopping cart piled with
contemporary black desktop items and colorful kitchen
gadgets. In two visits, she says, she's plunked down more
than $130 to update her closets, kitchen and desk. "I don't
have the time to dig through a lot of junk," she says of her
cleanup efforts.
   That, retailers say, is an important selling point. "Most
people who are space-conscious are time-sensitive as well,"
says Carol Fraser, director of the Hold Everything catalog.
The stores tap into the same mentality that has made
enormous, multisectioned diary planners such a hit.
   Some say that the merchandise appeals to customers because
it allows them to attribute their sloppiness to a technical,
rather than a personal, flaw. "You're not buying a crutch for
your character," says Dr. Jerald Jellison, a psychology
professor at the University of Southern California. "You just
don't have the right equipment" to be neat.

   PepsiCo Plans Extensive Ad Campaign
   To Contest Coke's Overseas Dominance

   LOS ANGELES -- After toiling for decades in the shadow of
Coca-Cola Co.'s world-wide soft-drink dominance, PepsiCo Inc.
is planning its most concerted and aggressive catch-up
campaign ever.
   Gathering bottlers here from all parts of the globe for
its first ever international convention, Pepsi announced
plans to spend more than $1 billion over the next five years
to upgrade plants, improve distribution and bolster marketing
programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company also outlined a strategy to target certain
fast-growing market segments -- including diet soft drinks,
and fountain and vending machines -- that are still in such
an infant stage abroad that even Coke has no commanding
advantage yet.
   Pepsi estimated that such moves will more than double its
overseas soft-drink volume by 1995 to five billion cases from
about two billion currently.
   "Pepsi can close the gap against Coke internationally just
as we did here in the U.S.," Christopher A. Sinclair, the
newly appointed president of Pepsi's international business,
said.
   Pepsi's optimism, however, was met with some skepticism by
industry observers. With Coke's more than 2-to-1 market-share
lead in the international arena, analysts said it's unlikely
that Pepsi can significantly close the gap abroad overnight.
   Moreover, although Pepsi said its $1 billion budget is
"substantially" more than it has invested in the past,
industry observers said Pepsi will probably have to spend
substantially more if it ever hopes to catch Coke.
   In 1989, Coke had about $4.8 billion in revenue from
overseas, while Pepsi had $1 billion. Coke estimates its
international market share is 47% while Pepsi's is less than
half that.
   "I think they're going to have a tough time catching Coke
really soon," said Gary Hemphill, editor of Beverage Industry
magazine. "At the same time, there's so much growth
internationally that there's room for both of them out
there."
   While U.S. soft-drink volume has slowed to about a 3%
annual growth rate recently from 4% to 5% in the 1980s, the
international market is expected to grow in 8% to 10% leaps
annually for years to come.
   "This meeting acknowledges where the soft-drink industry
is really headed: offshore," said Jesse Meyers, publisher of
Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter. "While Coke has a
substantial lead, there are still unplayed cards in Southeast
Asia, Russia, and now Eastern Europe."
   A Coca-Cola spokesman dismissed Pepsi's plans to match
Coke overseas as "dreaming."
   The Pepsi convention seemed like an orchestrated attempt
to rally overseas bottlers and to convince them once and for
all that Pepsi is committed to the soda business abroad.
