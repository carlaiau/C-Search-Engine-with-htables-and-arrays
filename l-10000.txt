because
investors
aren
betting
on
further
sizable
declines
among

the

however

stock
exchanges
on

short

dropped
it

although
many
analysts
and
investors
are
unsure
about
the
outlook
for

in
computerrelated

and
prices
of
many
of
those

in
recent
weeks
shortselling
of
otc
technology
stocks
wasn
nearly
as
heavy
as
it
was
last

when
similar
conditions
prevailed
michael
murphy
who
edits
newsletters
on
shortselling
and
on

issues
in
san
francisco
said
the
reason
is
that
shortsellers
don
view
the
group
as
overpriced
the
valuations
just
aren
excessive
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
market
mr
murphy
said
so
even
though
the
outlook
may
be
shaky
with
the
stocks
already
down
the
opportunity
to
make
money
on
the
short
side
is
reduced
among

many

are
flocking
to
issues
of
companies
with
ties
to
the
junk
bond
market
including
first
executive
many
analysts
have
said
that
if
the
economy
goes
into
recession
there
could
be
wave
of
defaults
among
these
highyield
highrisk
debt
issues
although
heavy
shortselling
is
generally
regarded
as
bearish
sign
for
stocks
it
can
be
interpreted
more
positively
on
the
grounds
that
shorted
shares
must
eventually
be
replaced
through
buying
in
addition
changes
in
short
interest
in
some
stocks
may
be
caused
by
arbitrage
for
example
an
investor
may
seek
to
profit
during
some
merger
situations
by
buying
stock
in
one
company
involved
and
shorting
the
stock

the

again

show
that

are
married
couples
with

children
under

are
married
couples

the
disparity
is
partly
because
there
are
more
couples
without
children
than
with

million
vs

but
it
also
due
to
the
fact
that

the

canceled
major
diskdrive
product
announcement
scheduled
for
yesterday
an
embarrassing
move
that
dims
ibm
shortterm
outlook
the
computer
giant
contacted
customers
in
the
past
few
days
after
running
into
lastminute
technical
problems
that
could
delay
the
products
until
at
least
early
next
year
consultants
said
that
will
hurt
because
growth
in
ibm
huge
diskdrive
business
has
slowed
this
year
as
such
competitors
as
amdahl
corp
hitachi
ltd
and
storage
technology
corp
have
caught
up
with
ibm
technology
and
waged
price
war
the
new
highend
products
would
have
put
ibm
safely
back
out
in
front
market
researchers
had
predicted
ibm
would
generate
some
billion
of
revenue
from
highend
disk
drives
this
year
thomas
donovan
an
analyst
at
idc
financial
services
said
billion
to
billion
of
the
billion
had
been
expected
to
come
from
the
new
products
he
said
that
ibm
has
been
telling
customers
that
it
may
still
be
able
to
ship
the
disk
drives
in
volume
this
year
but
that
he
thinks
they
may
not
be
available
until
any
time
major
company
pulls
an
announcement
at
the
last
minute
after
they
ve
invited
analysts
to
briefings
and
lined
up
hotel
rooms
you
know
there
major
problem
he
said
an
ibm
spokeswoman
while
confirming
that
the
announcement
had
been
pulled
wouldn
explain
what
caused
the
problems
or
say
when
the
products
would
be
available
steve
cohen
securities
analyst
at
soundview
financial
group
inc
said
ibm
is
putting
together
an
interim
marketing
plan
and
you
don
put
one
together
if
you
re
just
going
to
have
day
slip
he
said
that
even
if
customers
continue
to
buy
from
ibm
the
profit
margins
on
the
existing
products
are
much
lower
than
they
would
have
been
on
the
new
ones
it
isn
surprising
that
ibm
would
have
trouble
with
the
technology
highend
disk
drives
which
are
hooked
up
to
mainframes
use
phenomenally
complex
technology
moreover
the
new
products
are
expected
to
store
three
times
as
much
as
current
drives
while
operating
at
much
faster
speeds
what
surprising
is
that
ibm
didn
catch
the
problem
earlier
in
its
testing
program
ibm
knows
how
treacherous
diskdrive
technology
can
be
in
the
early
the
company
had
disastrous
delays
after
announcing
some
disk
drives
more
recently
ibm
went
through
long
delay
before
shipping
the
current
generation
of
controllers
used
with
the
disk
drives
this
year
ibm
has
also
gone
through
some
wellpublicized
mainframe
manufacturing
problems
as
well
as
problems
in
making
personal
computers
and
lowend
disk
drives
together
with
the
latest
problem
those
incidents
have
some
analysts
wondering
whether
ibm
didn
lose
too
much
expertise
through
an
early
retirement
program
and
whether
it
hasn
dispersed
decisionmaking
bit
too
much
separately
ibm
announced
an
unusual
agreement
under
which
it
will
build
and
operate
data
center
for
eastman
kodak
co
the
ibm
operation
will
take
over
the
work
done
by
four
kodak
centers
and
kodak
workers
will
become
ibm
employees
kodak
will
continue
to
develop
its
own
software
applications
and
plot
its
own
strategy
for
information
services
but
said
it
hopes
to
cut
costs
as
much
as
by
turning
the
operation
over
to
ibm
david
mcdowell
an
ibm
vice
president
said
such
an
arrangement
doesn
necessarily
make
sense
for
all
companies
but
he
said
that
if
we
ve
accomplished
anything
hope
it
that
we
ve
demonstrated
how
far
we
ll
go
in
putting
together

mexico
trying

is
counting
on
its

to
be
the

no

more
important
to

alfa
sprawling

amounted
to

gross

it
been
long
painful
process
but
we
ve
learned
our
lesson
you
have
to
be
lean
and
efficient
says
bernardo
garza
sada
the
company
chairman
the
alfa
story
began
almost
century
ago
in
redbrick
brewery
run
by
two
brothersinlaw
isaac
garza
and
francisco
sada
the
brewery
expanded
vertically
producing
everything
from
the
glass
for
its
bottles
to
the
grain
for
its
brew
and
then
branched
out
into
steel
in
the
founders
heirs
split
the
company
into
two
firms
alfa
and
grupo
industrial
visa
which
went
its
own
way
as
mexico
emerged
as
an
oilproducing
power
in
the
alfa
symbolized
the
country
gogo

launching
an
aggressive
diversification
program
it
swallowed
up
resort
hotels
on
the
pacific
coast
bought
an
interest
in

only
private
television
network
and
went
into
manufacturing
ventures
in
everything
from
industrial
steam
turbines
to
mopeds
assets
revenue
and
profits
all
more
than
quadrupled
between
and
but
as
the
size
of
the
company
was
growing
so
was
the
debt
load
and
meanwhile
earnings
of
many
of
the
new
units
were
stagnating
no
one
noticed
then
but
it
was
false
prosperity
says
guillermo
barba
director
of
alfa
food
operations
when
the
collapse
of
oil
prices
provoked
two
steep
peso
devaluations
in
and
the
dollars
needed
to
service
foreign
debt
became
seven
times
more
expensive
alfa
equity
was
wiped
out
leading
alfa
roll
of
creditors
were
citibank
and
continental
illinois
now
continental
bank
each
owed
million
in
december
of
alfa
called
an
emergency
meeting
with
bankers
to
inform
them
of
its
crisis
the
same
sort
of
debt
squeeze
that
would
envelope
the
mexican
government
nine
months
later
many
bankers
were
angry
at
alfa
claiming
they
had
been
given
misleading
earnings
projections
that
led
them
to
lend
more
than
they
would
have
otherwise
alfa
says
the
situation
deteriorated
so
rapidly
that
it
was
hard
to
make
accurate
projections
nevertheless
alfa
immediately
took
tough
negotiating
stance
suggesting
to
bankers
why
mexicans
sometimes
call
the
businessmen
of
alfa
home
city
the
cheapskates
of
monterrey
when
alfa
and
other
indebted
monterrey
conglomerates
began
pressing
banks
for
strikingly
similar
terms
bankers
added
an
appellation
of
their
own
the
monterrey
debtors
cartel
alfa
relations
with
the
banks
would
reach
their
nadir
when
the
company
pulled
out
of
tentative
debt
restructuring
that
had
taken
months
to
negotiate
saying
falling
oil
prices
changed
the
economic
outlook
too
much
while
negotiations
moved
at
crawl
alfa
acted
urgently
to
overhaul
its
inefficient
operations
selling
off
manufacturing
ventures
in
television
sets
bicycles
and
tractors
it
reduced
the
bloated
corporate
staff
to
from
cut
its
work
force
in
half
to
tightened
up
on
working
capital
and
cut
energy
use
in
its
steel
division
by
onethird
alfa
even
eliminated
most
of
its
subsidy
to
the
alfa
cultural
center
major
mexican
museum
by
levying
an
admission
fee
and
installing
moneymaking
gift
shops
and
cafeterias
it
got
help
from
the
government
too
in
the
form
of
an
emergency
million
loan
an
easing
of
price
controls
and
program
that
protected
indebted
companies
from
currency
devaluations
alfa
also
saw
that
it
had
to
strengthen
moneylosing
operations
such
as
its
food
division
which
sells
processed
meats
in
the
boom
days
proud
alfa
would
never
have
considered
marketing
its
products
in
mexico
ubiquitous
momandpop
stores
or
changarros
but
now
alfa
makes
them
priority

and
the

but
mr
palapa
patience
has
its
reward
the
woman
not
only
buys
several
alfa
meat
products
but
allows
mr
palapa
to
festoon
the
store
battered
walls
with
alfa
advertisements
in
depressed
economy
even
the
smallest
sales
are
important
says
mr
palapa
these
days
meat
sales
to
the
onceignored
changarros
in
mexico
city
average
tons
month
and
sometimes
exceed
sales
to
supermarket
chains
to
earn
dollars
alfa
also
has
made
an
allout
push
to
promote
exports
from
subsidiaries
such
as
nemak
maker
of
auto
cylinder
heads
nemak

says

down
so
well
that

this

similar
improvements
in
alfa
petrochemical
operations
have
pushed
exports
to
million
from
million
in
turning
around
its
operations
gave
alfa
the
wherewithal
to
win
its
war
of
attrition
with
creditors
in
late
alfa
reached
preliminary
agreements
to
swap
debt
for
equity
in
its
holding
company
its
steel
unit
and
its
food
division
in
the
largest
of
the
three
transactions
the
holding
company
gave
up
million
in
cash
million
in
mexican
government
debt
and
of
its
equity
to
the
banks
which
in
turn
agreed
to
slash
alfa
debt
to
them
to
million
from
billion
for
each
dollar
of
debt
the
banks
ended
up
with
cents
and
portion
of
share
in
alfa
some
feared
glitch
and
rushed
to
the
secondary
market
to
sell
their
rights
to
payment
and
stock
they
got
the
cent
payment
upfront
but
surrendered
their
shares
for
nothing
these
banks
came
to
regret
their
haste
just
few
days
after
the
restructuring
deal
finally
closed
in
december
the
mexican
government
stopped
gradual
devaluations
of
the
peso
the
move
which
caused
the
peso
value
to
increase
against
that
of
the
dollar
in
relative
terms
worked
to
the
advantage
of
companies
such
as
alfa
that
had
debt
in
dollars
and
alfa
was
further
strengthened
by
surge
in
international
petrochemical
prices
as
well
as
by
governmentgranted
increases
in
steel
prices
much
faster
than
even
its
own

had
expected
alfa
was
back
on
its
feet
in
operating
income
was
record
million
special
gains
related
to
the
debt
restructuring
and
the
fixed
exchange
rate
added
million
more
thus
last
may
alfa
wasn
greatly
strained
to
pay
million
to
the
banks
for
of
the
holdingcompany
equity
especially
since
the
buyback
price
was
below
the
stock
book
value
banks
that
had
hung
on
until
may
recovered
about
cents
for
each
dollar
they
had
lent
some
banks
are
still
holding
alfa
stock
and
are
glad
of
it
the
stock
that
some
banks
judged
worthless
less
than
two
years
ago
has
soared
more
than
since
the
restructuring
was
completed
not
all
the
strategies
alfa
used
are
feasible
for
an
indebted
central

such
as
mexico
drastic

belttightening
risks
the
kind
of
upheaval
that
recently
erupted
in
venezuela
and
argentina
following

austerity
programs
mexico
has
made
distinct
efforts
to
become
more
efficient
but
miguel
mancera
the
governor
of
its
central
bank
says
that
for
the
public
debt
to
have
been
diminished
along
with
that
of
the
private
debt
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
run
much
larger
budget
surpluses
which
implies
even
further
sacrifices
by
the
mexican
population
mr
cumming
the
alfa
director
agrees
businessmen
don
have
to
worry
about
politics
when
they
re
running
their
companies
but
governments
do
he
says
the
independentminded
people
of
monterrey
have
hailed
the
mexicanization
of
their
hometown
flagship
but
alfa
chairman
garza
sada
isn
letting
himself
get
carried
away
the
debt
crisis
doesn
end
completely
for
alfa
until
it
ends
for
mexico
he
says
nevertheless
reducing
the
passive
investment
of
the
banks
has
already
given
alfa
new
operating
flexibility
the
company
now
has
more
room
to
attract
productive
foreign
investments
without
exceeding
legal
limits
on
foreign
ownership
in
mexican
companies
alfa
recently
sold
stake
in
its
paperproducing
subsidiary
to
chicagobased
stone
container
corp
which
is
providing
major
infusion
of
capital
and
in
the
biggest
sign
yet
of
its
resurgence
alfa
is
seeking
bank
financing
for
about
onethird
of
the
cost
of
new
million
petrochemical
plant
though
this
might
seem
like
heading
down
the
same
road
that
led
to
trouble
before
the
company
says
it
different
story
now
the
dollar
loans
would
be
backed
by
dollar
revenues
from
the
plant
exports
some
bitter
foreign
bankers
say
they
will
never
consider
making
loans
to
alfa
again
mr
garza
sada
thinks
they
ll
come
around
eventually
bankers
are
business
people
he
says
and
if
they
see
an
attractive
opportunity
they
will
surely

by

at

the

which
was

early
this

effectively
would
have
kept
shuwa
from
exercising
power
over
the
two

chains
by
diminishing
its

shuwa
went
to

won
an
injunction
against
the

placement
key
reversal
of
what
had
been
an

the

well
as
to

which
was

one

was

ante
up
an

million
in

lines
but
the
banks
demanded
that
unlike
their
other
loans
those
new
lines
be
secured
with
hooker
assets
hooker
asked
the
banks
for
an
immediate
injection
of
million
one
banker
says
but
the
banks
weren
satisfied
that
hooker
could
provide
sufficient
security
for
the
new
loans
furthermore
the
banks
became
aware
that
hooker
needed
more
cash
than
the
creditors
had
thought
hooker
officials
in
australia
refused
to
comment
beyond
the
terse
statement
which
also
threatened
legal
action
against
the
banks
because
they
haven
made
the
additional
funds
available
and
are
terminating
the
socalled
moratorium
on
debt
repayments
but
bankers
close
to
the
situation
say
hooker
bank
lenders
effectively
are
forcing
the
company
voluntarily
to
ask
the
australian
courts
to
appoint
provisional
liquidator
as
early
as
today
if
the
company
directors
fail
to
do
so
the

are
likely

ask

nicholas

the

will
continue
to
do
business
on
the
merits
with
paramount
which
is
closely
linked
in
number
of
business
ventures
and
contractual
relationships
but
analysts
and
industry
executives
wonder
whether
it
can
ever
be
business
as
usual
again
between
the
two
sides
after
the
hostilities
of
the
fight
of
equal
concern
some
industry
executives
say
is
whether
the
battle
that
pitted
time
and
warner
against
longtime
supplier
and
partner
paramount
signals
new
era
of
antagonism
among
companies
in
the
media
business
although
paramount
lost
its
bid
for
time
its
willingness
to
make
hostile
bid
is
departure
from
past
practice
in
the
entertainment
industry
and
some
in
the
industry
worry
that
it
may
spur
others
to
try
the
same
tactic
as
companies
scramble
to
follow
time
lead
and
get
bigger
fast
in
an
industry
that
in
the
past
has
been
marked
by
fairly
cordial
relationships
between
the
major
players
the
fight
for
control
of

engender
collegial
atmosphere
says
barry
diller
who
once
ran
paramount
pictures

is
now
chairman
of
news
corp
fox
inc
this
was
public
and
formal
announcement
that
the
hostilities
have
begun
industry
executives
believe
the
relationships
between
the
two
sides
may
be
particularly
strained
because
of
the
heated
nature
of
the
takeover
battle
during
much
of
the
fight
time
executives
railed
at
paramount
top
executives
particularly
chief
executive
martin
davis
accusing
him
of
going
back
on
his
word
in
making
run
at
time
charge
he
has
denied
time
and
warner
also
hired
detective
firm
to
dig
up
dirt
on
paramount
and
publicly
derided
the
company
by
bringing
up
number
of
past
controversies
the
company
has
been
involved
in
paramount
retaliated
by
bringing
up
equally
controversial
issues
in
the
background
of
warner
chief
executive
steven
ross
among
the
more
crucial
relationships
between
time
warner
and
paramount
is
the
longterm
contract
under
which
time
home
box

unit
is
obligated
to
buy
all
of

premiere

next

michael
fuchs
chairman

says
his
attitude
now
is
that
the
fight
was
all
done
at
the
respective
tops
of
the
companies
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
frank
mancuso
and
his
people
mr
mancuso
chairman
of
the
paramount
pictures
unit
agrees
the
relationship
with
hbo
has
always
been
good
one
and
nothing
altered
that
during
the
course
of
the
events
in
new
york
he
said
there
no
reason
to
believe
anything
will
be
any
different
going
forward
and
he
said
he
and
mr
davis
will
continue
to
nourish
relationships
that
are
mutually
beneficial
with
time
warner
paramount
and
warner
are
also
partners
in
cinemerica
theaters
warner
bought
interest
in
the
theater
chain
from
paramount
last
year
for
million
and
the
two
have
been
closely
linked
in
managing
its
operations
mr
mancuso
says
that
during
the
takeover
battle
he
was
in
frequent
contact
with
warner
bros
chairman
robert
daly
and
president
terry
semel
we
continued
to
function
based
on
what
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
partnership
he
said
the
cinemerica
stake
was
identified
by
bankers
involved
in
the
time
purchase
of
warner
as
candidate
for
potential
sale
to
raise
cash
but
time
has
said
it
hasn
made
any
such
decisions
and
in
any
event
the
sale
would
be
impossible
without
paramount
consent
time
and
warner
are
linked
in
other
ways
too
combined
the
time
warner
cable
systems
are
among
the
largest
buyers
of
paramount
madison
square
garden
network
and
its
owned
usa
network
we
will
continue
to

as
we
would
with
any
other
company
time
mr
nicholas
said
if
we
produce
product
at

warner
that
paramount
can
use
we
hope
they
will
stop
here
and
buy
from
us
mr

wsj
what
is
happening
to
income
in
america
bluestone
we
see
the
following
trends
beginning
in
the
early
first
stagnation
if
not
an
absolute
decline
in
hourly
wages
weekly
earnings
and
average
annual
earnings
second
growing
inequality
in
earnings
particularly
among
men
third
growing
proportion
of
the
labor
force
earning
lower
wages
at
least
among
fulltime
workers
there
seems
to
have
been
very
little
reversal
in
any
of
those
trends
since
the
economic
recovery
beginning
in
levy
there
been
trend
toward
greater
inequality
in
men
earnings
in
most
of
the
postworld
war
ii
period
it
grows
faster
sometimes
than
other
times
and
that
trend
certainly
has
been
there
in
the
past
decade
there
is
no
particular
trend
one
way
or
another
in
women
earnings
if
you
look
at
family
incomes
from
the
end
of
the
second
world
war
to
the
late
family
incomes
grew
moderately
more
equal
they
grew
sharply
less
equal
in
the
early
historically
inequality
grows
when
you
go
into
recession
and
declines
when
you
come
out
but
inequality
today
is
greater
than
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
recession
when
incomes
are
growing
fast
inequality
has
less
meaning
because
the
poor
are
getting
richer
and
the
rich
are
getting
richer
even
faster
but
everybody
better
off
because
of
the
general
stagnation
of
earnings
this
decade
that
not
the
case
now
relative
decline
means
an
absolute
decline
the
sharpest
example
is
that
if
you
look
at
workers
in
their
late
and
early
with
high
school
education
in
the
early
they
were
averaging
in
today
dollars
and
today
they
are
making
and
the
last
point
is
that
there
have
been
sharp
changes
in
the
kinds
of
families
at
the
bottom
of
the
distribution
in
the
the
bottom
fifth
of
families
contained
maybe
onesixth
of
all
kids
today
it
onequarter
linden
don
think
there
much
debate
that
income
has
been
growing
much
less
rapidly
than
in
the
but
why
is
this
going
on
my
view
is
that
there
have
been
monumental
social
and
demographic
changes
in
the
country
but
it
remains
fact
that
percapita
disposable
income
rose
by
total
of
between
and
and
by
between
and
percapita
disposable
personal
income
rose
by
an
annual
rate
of
from
through
at
that
rate
the
standard
of
living
of
the
average
american
doubles
in
years
that
been
our
past
trend
it
is
our
current
trend
when
we
survey
young
workers
they
say
they
are
doing
considerably
better
than
their
parents
were
at
their
age
and
they
re
right
on
average
today
young
have
an
income
that
is
in
real
terms
higher
than
their
parents
at
the
same
age
vedder
from
to
economic
growth
reduced
poverty
from
to
we
see
little
if
any
decline
in
poverty
even
though
there
has
been
some
economic
growth
why
has
economic
growth
not
resulted
in
the
continuation
of
the
reduction
in
poverty
decreasing
proportion
of
the
poor
are
working
poor
of
the
million
families
that
are
poor
half
don
contain
wage
earner
public
policies
are
leading
people
to
take
options
that
consign
them
to
poverty
wsj
let
begin
by
considering
individual
earnings
from
labor
what
happening
and
why
levy
low
wages
among
young
high
school
graduates
come
from
weak
manufacturing
employment
manufacturing
got
clobbered
in
the
recession
and
then
got
the
short
end
of
the
stick
in
the
recovery
because
of
the
high
dollar
put
aside
the
question
of
good
jobs
and
bad
jobs
suppose
you
had
group
of
women
and
large
number
went
into
secretarial
positions
suddenly
you
abolish
half
of
those
jobs
women
average
wages
would
fall
even
if
those
vanished
jobs
weren
good
jobs
in
the
lot
of
young
men
without
college
educations
had
to
scramble
for
any
kind
of
job
because
the
factories
weren
hiring
bluestone
as
it
turns
out
and
one
of
the
proponents
of
the
deindustrialization
thesis
the
shift
in
employment
from
goods
production
to
services
does
not
by
itself
explain
the
growth
in
inequality
because
inequality
is
growing
in
all
sectors
think
something
is
happening
to
educational
criteria
went
to
public
high
school
in
detroit
and
graduated
in
about
half
my
class
went
on
to
college
half
didn
at
my
th
and
th
class
reunions
those
who
went
on
to
college
were
making
somewhat
more
than
those
who
had
not
but
the
gap
wasn
enormous
we
were
in
detroit
remember
but
when
the
class
of
meets
for
its
anniversary
predict
the
gap
will
have
grown
enormously
in
goods
production
college
graduates
earned
times
as
much
as
high
school
dropouts
in
today
they
earn
times
as
much
but
the
service
economy
is
putting
more
and
more
of
premium
on
advanced
education
so
while
college
graduates
in
services
earned
times
as
much
as
high
school
dropouts
in
today
they
earn
times
as
much
there
certainly
is
relationship
between
the
decline
in
manufacturing
employment
and
the
growth
in
inequality
but
even
more
powerful
there
has
been
restructuring
within
industries
linden
but
much
of
this
is
the
impact
of
the
baby
boom
generation
within
the
prime
age
range
of
to
when
earnings
are
at
their
highest
the
proportion
of
the
category
accounted
for
by
the
younger
less
wellpaid
cohort
of
to
yearolds
was
in
in
it
was
bluestone
but
those
are
the
same
people
who
in
the
previous
period
of
greater
equality
were
even
younger
to
and
so
they
should
have
been
lowering
wage
rates
even
more
then
linden
but
their
participation
in
the
labor
force
was
very
slight
most
of
them
were
still
in
school
levy
the
growth
in
inequality
among
younger
workers
is
as
important
as
the
growth
of
inequality
between
younger
and
older
workers
and
between
high
school
and
college
graduates
inequality
grown
lot
the
economy
in
lot
of
turbulence
wsj
perhaps
as
the
economy
becomes
more
entrepreneurial
as
foreign
competition
mounts
as
small
business
proliferates
the
price
society
is
prepared
to
pay
for
talent
is
greater
linden
there
was
period
in
which
you
could
earn
your
bread
by
the
sweat
of
your
brow
now
as
the
economy
becomes
more
complex
bluestone
you
have
to
use
something
above
the
brow
levy
the
economy
in
the
and
was
certainly
not
sclerotic
but
the
inequality
in
men
earnings
was
less
than
it
is
now
compared
to
the
early
larger
proportion
of
men
earns
over
in
constant
dollars
and
larger
proportion
earns
under
but
smaller
proportion
is
earning
between
and
the
top
has
increased
because
if
you
want
to
put
good
face
on
it
there
is
more
recognition
of
talent
and
if
you
want
to
put
bad
face
on
it
because
people
feel
less
of
sense
of
restraint
than
they
used
to
markets
are
there
all
the
time
but
how
much
do
you
allow
the
full
impact
of
the
market
to
come
to
bear
on
wages
and
how
much
do
you
dampen
the
market
through
custom
certainly
in
the
we
let
more
of
the
market
be
felt
if
the
minimum
wage
erodes
through
inflation
that
good
if
you
can
get
really
big
salary
by
threatening
to
jump
to
another
firm
even
though
it
nine
times
what
your
colleagues
are
making
go
ahead
that
ok
if
you
want
to
take
it
one
step
further
this
may
ultimately
be
traceable
to
the
stagnation
of
earnings
when
everybody
is
getting
better
off
very
fast
you
may
say
well
ve
got
mine
but
when
people
get
little
edgy
about
the
future
there
more
of
temptation
to
play
for
the
short
run
vedder
we
all
agree
that
the
growth
in
earnings
from
work
has
slowed
down
dramatically
since
the
mid
won
agree
to
any
specific
numbers
because
there
are
complex
issues
here
fringe
benefits
inflation
deflators
the
dates
you
use
but
don
think
there
any
question
that
the
measures
show
some
increase
in
inequality
over
the
past
years
linden
remember
that
the
period
from
the
end
of
the
war
to
the
was
extraordinary
we
had
depression
and
then
war
in
the
and
so
there
was
huge
backlog
of
sophisticated
technology
that
had
not
been
implementedthere
was
whole
network
of
growth
impetus
bluestone
but
there
whole
series
of
institutional
factors
at
work
too
at
one
time
in
this
country
we
had
more
than
third
of
the
labor
force
in
unions
in
manufacturing
as
much
as
by
demanding
raises
in
pennies
per
hour
rather
than
in
percentage
terms
by
fighting
for
promotion
by
seniority
rather
than
pay
for
knowledge
unions
have
been
force
for
greater
equality
with
the
demise
of
unions
you
have
freer
market
in
wages
freer
market
has
meant
greater
disparities
in
the
average
chief
executive
of
fortune
company
earned
times
as
much
as
the
average
factory
worker
and
times
as
much
as
the
average
schoolteacher
in
he
made
times
as
much
as
factory
worker
and
times
as
much
as
teacher
levy
the
big
change
was
on
the
demand
side
we
know
that
manufacturing
is
very
sensitive
to
recessions
and
we
also
know
that
in
this
last
recovery
the
high
dollar
was
very
hard
on
manufacturing
so
you
re
suddenly
taking
big
chunk
of
the
demand
for
less
welleducated
labor
and
putting
it
into
shock
linden
what
you
re
saying
is
that
we
are
having
an
economic
episode
related
to
the
fortunes
of
the
dollar
levy
would
say
yes
but
how
long
that
episode
lasts
has
lot
to
do
with
public
policy
linden
but
an
episode
is
nothing
we
have
to
be
too
desperately
concerned
about
it
painful
to
live
through
but
it
will
not
continue
levy
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
young
person
the
question
is
what
are
the
chances
that
they
re
going
to
outearn
their
parents
that
depends
on
something
can
predict
very
well
productivity
growth
yearold
man
today
is
pretty
certainly
making
more
than
his
father
did
when
he
was
the
difference
is
that
the
father
saw
pretty
rapid
wage
growth
for
most
of
his
career
for
the
son
it
an
open
question
if
you
do
simple
projections
you
will
find
that
for
the
collegeeducated
son
of
collegeeducated
father
the
son
will
top
out
at
about
or
constant
dollars
more
than
his
father
which
isn
outstanding
but
isn
bad
but
for
high
schooleducated
sons
of
high
schooleducated
fathers
at
current
projections
the
son
won
outearn
his
father
wsj
what
about
collegeeducated
sons
of
high
schooleducated
fathers
levy
the
proportion
of
high
school
graduates
going
on
to
college
has
stabilized
at
since
the
early
linden
but
in
the
generation
of
the
fathers
of
the
babyboomers
only
went
to
college
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
notion
of
the
babyboomers
not
doing
as
well
as
their
parents
is
nonsense
of
course
while
they
re
doing
better
now
this
is
only
snapshot
in
time
will
they
do
better
into
the
future
that
as
unpredictable
as
tomorrow
gnp
vedder
from
until
we
had
an
increase
in
equality
combined
with
economic
growth
since
we
ve
had
an
increase
of
inequality
along
with
some
slowing
of
economic
growth
but
over
the
long
run
that
trend
will
probably
reverse
itself
even
in
the
absence
of
public
policy
what
we
should
be
worrying
about
are
the
very
poor
we
have
not
been
terribly
successful
in
eliminating
poverty
in
the
united
states
that
where
we
should
focus
our
attention
wsj
how
important
are
racial
and
regional
phenomena
vedder
the
employmenttopopulation
rate
among
blacks
was
higher
in
than
it
was
in
vs
for
whites
it
rose
from
to
don
think
anyone
would
seriously
argue
that
it
because
of
increased
racial
discrimination
part
of
the
black
decline
does
relate
to
things
like
changing
skill
requirements
but
part
of
it
relates
to
family
structure
and
to
things
that
affect
work
effort
like
public
assistance
levy
of
course
for
femaleheaded
families
earning
less
than
are
white
vedder
maybe
but
among
unrelated
individuals
inequality
for
whites
has
fallen
for
blacks
it
has
risen
if
you
compare
families
the
gini
coefficient
the
technical
measure
of
inequality
has
risen
basis
points
for
blacks
and
for
whites
and
income
disparity
among
blacks
was
greater
than
among
whites
to
begin
with
bluestone
while
this
is
true
among
blacks
it
part
of
general
trend
the
white
high
school
graduate
or
dropout
isn
doing
as
well
as
years
ago
either
in
both
relative
and
absolute
terms
vedder
and
for
regions
reversing
the
recent
history
of
the
it
been
the
relatively
high
income
states
that
had
the
highest
growth
rates
in
the
bluestone
in
the
six
new
england
states
the
proportion
of
the
work
force
in
lowwage
jobs
went
down
between
and
but
everywhere
else
it
went
up
in
the
midwest
it
began
rising
in
and
exploded
after
from
to
in
the
south
it
went
from
to
in
the
west
from
to
levy
but
most
of
that
decline
is
concentrated
in
the
middle
west
if
you
take
out
the
big
industrial
states
the
high
schoolcollege
gap
in
wage
rates
among
young
men
hasn
changed
whole
lot
and
there
your
story
heavy
industry
is
falling
apart
linden
but
autos
and
steel
account
for
just
or
of
total
employment
we
have
lost
vastly
more
industrial
jobs
in
lowpaying
textile
and
apparel
industries
levy
it
isn
just
autos
and
steel
that
are
being
removed
when
you
take
out
those
states
bluestone
and
even
for
people
in
textiles
those
jobs
are
better
than
the
alternatives
working
as
security
guards
or
janitors
or
in
warehouses
or
frying
hamburgers
and
the
benefits
of
course
were
much
greater
even
in
the
lowerwage
manufacturing
industries
wsj
let
go
beyond
the
individual
earnings
data
what
happening
to
total
family
income
levy
income
per
worker
really
has
slowed
down
family
living
standards
haven
suffered
as
much
but
that
because
we
now
have
twoincome
families
with
one
kid
instead
of
oneincome
families
with
three
kids
and
also
because
even
as
maleearnings
inequality
has
grown
femaleincome
inequality
has
been
unchanged
linden
in
the
lowest
quintile
of
the
family
income
distribution
singleparent
families
grew
between
and
from
to
of
the
total
family
population
over
those
years
there
was
increase
in
the
number
of
husbandwife
families
while
other
families
increased
by
of
the
total
increase
between
and
in
households
earning
less
than
were
single
individuals
were
femaleheaded
families
in
the
top
quintile
of
families
there
has
been
an
extraordinary
growth
in
the
number
of
working
wives
in
some
of
the
families
in
the
top
fifth
had
working
wives
in
some
the
number
of
working
wives
in
the
top
quintile
increased
by
how
much
do
these
pulls
increase
inequality
it
difficult
to
say
but
these
are
not
small
changes
these
are
monumental
changes
because
the
baby
boom
was
monumental
just
between
and
the
total
number
of
persons
working
went
up
by
vedder
in
real
term
