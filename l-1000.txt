should
be
worrying
about
are
the
very
poor
we
have
not
been
terribly
successful
in
eliminating
poverty
in
the
united
states
thats
where
we
should
focus
our
attention
wsj
how
important
are
racial
and
regional
phenomena
vedder
the
employmenttopopulation
rate
among
blacks
was
higher
in
than
it
was
in
vs
for
whites
it
rose
from
to
dont
think
anyone
would
seriously
argue
that
its
because
of
increased
racial
discrimination
part
of
the
black
decline
does
relate
to
things
like
changing
skill
requirements
but
part
of
it
relates
to
family
structure
and
to
things
that
affect
work
effort
like
public
assi
stance
levy
of
course
for
femaleheaded
families
earning
less
than
are
white
vedder
maybe
but
among
unrelated
individuals
inequality
for
whites
has
fallen
for
blacks
it
has
risen
if
you
compare
families
the
gini
coefficient
the
technical
measure
of
inequality
has
risen
basis
points
for
blacks
and
for
whites
and
income
disparity
among
blacks
was
greater
than
among
whites
to
begin
with
bluestone
while
this
is
true
among
blacks
its
part
of
general
trend
the
white
high
school
graduate
or
dropout
isnt
doing
as
well
as
years
ago
either
in
both
rela
tive
and
absolute
terms
vedder
and
for
regions
reversing
the
recent
history
of
the
its
been
the
relatively
high
income
states
that
had
the
highest
growth
rates
in
the
bluestone
in
the
six
new
england
states
the
proportion
of
the
work
force
in
lowwage
jobs
went
down
between
and
but
everywhere
else
it
went
up
in
the
midwest
it
began
rising
in
and
exploded
after
from
to
in
the
south
it
went
from
to
in
the
west
from
to
levy
but
most
of
that
decline
is
concentrated
in
the
middle
west
if
you
take
out
the
big
industrial
states
the
high
schoolcollege
gap
in
wage
rates
among
young
me
hasnt
changed
whole
lot
and
theres
your
story
heavy
industry
is
falling
apart
linden
but
autos
and
steel
account
for
just
or
of
total
employment
we
have
lost
vastly
more
industrial
jobs
in
lowpaying
textile
and
apparel
industries
levy
it
isnt
just
autos
and
steel
that
are
being
removed
when
you
take
out
those
states
bluestone
and
even
for
people
in
textiles
those
jobs
are
better
than
the
alternatives
worki
ng
as
security
guards
or
janitors
or
in
warehouses
or
frying
hamburgers
and
the
benefits
of
course
were
much
greater
even
in
the
lowerwage
manufacturing
industries
wsj
lets
go
beyond
the
individual
earnings
data
whats
happening
to
total
family
income
levy
income
per
worker
really
has
slowed
down
family
living
standards
havent
suffered
as
much
but
thats
because
we
now
have
twoincome
familie
with
one
kid
instead
of
oneincome
families
with
three
kids
and
also
because
even
as
maleearnings
inequality
has
grown
femaleincome
inequality
has
been
unc
hanged
linden
in
the
lowest
quintile
of
the
family
income
distribution
singleparent
families
grew
be
tween
and
from
to
of
the
total
family
population
over
those
years
there
was
increase
in
the
number
of
husbandwife
families
while
other
amilies
increased
by
of
the
total
increase
between
and
in
households
earning
less
than
were
sin
gle
individuals
were
femaleheaded
families
in
the
top
quintile
of
families
there
has
been
an
extraordinary
growth
in
the
number
of
working
wives
in
some
of
the
families
in
the
top
fifth
had
working
wives
in
some
the
number
of
working
wives
in
the
top
quintile
increased
by
how
much
do
these
pulls
increase
inequality
its
difficult
to
say
but
these
are
not
small
changes
these
are
monumental
changes
because
the
baby
boom
was
monumental
just
between
and
the
total
number
of
persons
working
went
up
by
vedder
in
real
terms
not
in
nominal
terms
in
real
terms
payments
to
individuals
by
the
nited
states
government
went
up
from
billion
dollars
in
to
billion
in
that
has
implications
for
all
kinds
of
things
including
family
structure
and
work
effort
among
lowincome
americans
there
is
very
significant
negative
tax
in
the
form
of
new
benefits
that
have
appeared
since
the
medicaid
food
stamps
wic
benefits
that
have
impacted
advers
ely
on
lowincome
americans
participation
in
the
labor
force
at
the
upper
end
of
the
spectrum
meanwhile
labor
force
participation
is
increasing
why
partly
because
you
have
some
impact
when
you
cut
the
marginal
tax
rate
from
to
levy
but
inequality
in
family
incomes
increases
faster
when
you
ignore
wives
incomes
the
twoincome
family
exerts
less
of
an
equalizing
force
than
it
did
years
ago
because
its
mor
acceptable
for
the
wives
of
highincome
men
to
work
than
it
used
to
be
but
even
so
if
you
ignor
ed
all
wives
incomes
youd
have
more
not
less
inequality
inequality
is
certainly
exacerbated
by
the
growing
number
of
femaleheaded
families
the
reason
the
number
is
growing
is
open
to
question
welfare
changes
in
the
economy
in
mores
go
knows
what
from
about
to
about
the
number
of
cases
on
the
welfare
rolls
doubled
youd
be
fool
not
to
attribute
good
part
of
that
doubling
to
the
raising
of
benefits
and
the
at
tachment
of
food
stamps
and
medicaid
to
welfare
but
since
the
cash
value
of
welfare
has
fallen
off
substantiallyand
the
number
of
femaleheade
families
continues
to
grow
just
as
it
had
grown
in
the
early
before
the
benefits
were
raise
more
and
more
women
are
divorced
or
are
having
kids
out
of
wedlock
how
good
the
welfare
programs
are
may
determine
how
many
will
be
on
welfare
as
opposed
to
doing
som
ething
else
but
thats
it
where
they
agree
average
earnings
per
hour
have
not
improved
during
the
despite
the
economic
recovery

all
the
conventional

the

inequality
