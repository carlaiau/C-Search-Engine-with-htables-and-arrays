   John Blair &amp; Co. is close to an agreement to sell its TV station advertising representation operation and program production unit to an investor group led by James H. Rosenfield, a former CBS Inc. executive, industry sources said. 

   Industry sources put the value of the proposed acquisition at more than $100 million. 
John Blair was acquired last year by Reliance Capital Group Inc., which has been divesting itself of John Blair's major assets. 
John Blair represents about 130 local television stations in the placement of national and other advertising. 

   Mr. Rosenfield stepped down as a senior executive vice president of CBS Broadcasting in December 1985 under a CBS early retirement program. 
Neither Mr. Rosenfield nor officials of John Blair could be reached for comment.

   The maker of furniture and fabrics said it earlier expected first-quarter net to exceed the year-ago profit, but snowstorms in January and February forced the company to close some manufacturing facilities for as long as six days. 
The closings reduced operating profit, but that was substantially offset by reduced interest expenses, the company said. 

   Stanley said it doesn't anticipate a permanent loss of sales because of the closings. 
Substantially all the delayed shipments should be made in the second quarter, the company said.

   The anticipated loss will stem from plans of a subsidiary, Eskey Inc., to sell the assets and business of its Yale E. Key Inc. unit to a group of that company's managers and a private investor for about $15.5 million. 
Yale E. Key is a well-service concern. 

   In the year-ago third quarter, Yankee had net income of $762,000, or 12 cents a primary share, on revenue of $51.6 million. 
Earnings included a $615,000 write-down of an investment. 

   Yankee, an energy and financial services concern, said the sale is part of its plan to focus on its core businesses and reduce its total indebtedness. 
The company expects the sale to be completed later this month, but said it still requires a definitive agreement.

   BankEast Corp. said it signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire First Federal Bank of Nashua, N.H., for about $35 million. 

   In the proposed transaction, each of First Federal's common shares would be converted into $60 of BankEast common stock. 
BankEast said each First Federal common share would be swapped for 2.9 to 3.5 BankEast common shares. 
This is subject to certain adjustments, including ones based on First Federal's earnings before the closing date, BankEast said. 

   First Federal, which has about $270 million in assets, currently has 566,100 common shares outstanding. 
BankEast has about 10 million common shares outstanding and assets of $1.05 billion. 

   John Snow, BankEast's president, said his company has been interested in the Nashua market. 
The acquisition provides "an opportunity for BankEast to develop more substantially in that market," he said. 
"We now have a relatively small presence there." 
BankEast said it hopes to complete the acquisition by year's end. 

   John O'Brien, First Federal president, said he regards BankEast as a "very good banking organization." 
He said BankEast's offer appears to be "attractive to the bank's shareholders." 

   First Federal's shareholders still must vote on the acquisition, which also requires the execution of a definitive agreement and approval from regulators. 

   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, BankEast shares fell 25 cents to $16.50.

   Ohio Edison Co., seeking to lessen the financial impact of the Perry nuclear plant, said it completed a sale-leaseback transaction for a portion of its ownership in the plant. 

   Under the arrangement, the utility sold about 30% of its stake in one of the northern Ohio plant's two reactors -- the 1.2 million-kilowatt Unit 1 -- to a group of institutional investors led by Citicorp, a New York bank holding company. 
Ohio Edison owns about 30% of the unit. 

   Ohio Edison said the investors will pay it $509 million for the stake, then lease it back for 29 years at a rate estimated at 8.5% to 9% of the cash payment. 

   The Perry plant, whose ownership is split among several utilites, has been dogged by construction delays and cost overruns. 
Ohio Edison's outside auditors, citing uncertainties over whether the utility could recover the construction costs of the plant, qualified both its 1985 and 1986 financial statements. 

   Ohio Edison said the proceeds from the sale will finance the balance of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans incurred for the retirement of high-interest, long-term debt. 
The utility added that it plans later this year to ask the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to allow it to recover the cost of Perry. 

   Ohio Edison said the transaction will allow the equity investors to take advantage of federal tax benefits.

   Texaco Inc. said it reorganized certain of its oil-exploration operations. 

   The energy concern said it formed a "frontier exploration" department that will initiate and evaluate highly speculative oil opportunities for the company. 

   Frontier exploration was previously carried out by each of the company's regional divisions. 
Texaco said the consolidation of these operations will allow the geographic divisions to focus on the more mature, established oil basins. 

   Clarence P. Cazalot, 36 years old, was named general manager of the new department. 
He was formerly assistant to James W. Kinnear, Texaco chairman.

Decline in Net, Sales

   Canrad Inc. expects declines in first-quarter net income and sales, but increases in the full year, according to Carl Krieger, chief executive officer. 

   For the current quarter, Canrad, a maker of microwave equipment and ultraviolet lamps and systems, projects net income of about $120,000, or 10 cents a share, a 70% decline from year-earlier net of $409,000, or 34 cents a share, adjusted for a recent 5% stock dividend. 
Sales are expected to decrease about 8% to $8.5 million from $9.2 million a year earlier. 

   A drop in incoming orders for its microwave-equipment products used in the telecommunications industry is the major reason for Canrad's poor performance in the first quarter, Mr. Krieger said. 
Microwave equipment is the company's largest selling item as well as its most profitable, he noted. 

   Sales of the company's two other major products -- ultraviolet lamps and motion picture projection equipment -- are ahead of previous estimates, he said. 

   In spite of the poor performance in the first quarter, Canrad expects overall earnings and sales for 1987 to be higher than the previous year. 
Mr. Krieger forecasts that earnings will increase about 7% to $1.6 million, or $1.40 a share, from $1.5 million, or $1.29 a share, in 1986. 
Sales are expected to increase about 10% to $40 million from $36.6 million in 1986. 

   Mr. Krieger said that microwave equipment sales should be sharply higher in the second and third quarters.

   OKC Limited Partnership said a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a $21.5 million judgment against the company. 

   As reported last April, a federal district court in New Orleans ruled against OKC in a 1981 lawsuit filed by Aminoil USA Inc., now part of Phillips Petroleum Co. 
The court ruled that OKC hadn't paid Aminoil its full share of profits from an offshore petroleum lease that Aminoil had farmed out to OKC. 
The court ordered OKC to pay Phillips the profits, plus interest, which currently total about $21.5 million. 

   OKC said it plans to file a motion for a rehearing in an attempt to overturn the decision, but the company said its chances of winning a rehearing are "remote." 

   The company said it doesn't expect the ruling to have a major impact on earnings because it had already set aside about $14 million in reserves to cover the judgment and reached an agreement for a bank loan to pay the balance.

   Super Valu Stores Inc. said it plans $330 million in capital spending for fiscal 1988, a 9% decrease from the $363.7 million spent in the year ended Feb. 27. 

   The food wholesaler and retailer said the new budget is down primarily because the previous budget included funding for such major projects as new distribution centers at New Stanton, Pa., and Hammond, La. 

   The company said the new budget provides for significant additions to a number of its distribution centers, for upgrading computer equipment, for 10 new ShopKo discount department stores and for $70 million in financing for its independent retailer customers. 

   Super Valu said the largest portion of the budget, $181.8 million, or 55%, will be allocated to its retail support operations.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave its staff the authority to allow Consumers Power Co. to return its Palisades nuclear power plant to service after a 10-month shutdown for safety work. 

   The reactor has been idle since last May 19 when turbine problems triggered an automatic shutdown, said Joseph Fouchard, an NRC spokesman. 
Inspectors found three key safety-related valves failed to operate properly that day. 
Mr. Fouchard said the reactor shutdown "culminated a history of operating problems" at Palisades, on Lake Michigan near South Haven, Mich. 

   A spokesman for Jackson, Mich.-based Consumers Power said, "We're pleased. 
It brings the plant one step closer to restart." 
He said the company is "confident" that the NRC staff will allow the utility to restart the plant once Consumers Power has satisfactorily completed certain tests. 

   The commission voted 5-0 to authorize its staff to permit a restart after the staff reported on improvements in plant maintenance.

   SCANDINAVIAN AIRLINES SYSTEMS, or SAS, will defer for several more months a decision on whether to switch its order for 12 new airplanes to AIRBUS INDUSTRIE of Europe from MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORP. of the U.S. 

   Ulf Abrahamsson, SAS's vice president for fleet planning, said the carrier wants to study more carefully offers from the two aircraft builders. 
He said SAS also wants to determine the outcome of talks that could lead to the liberalization of air travel between the U.S. and Scandinavia. 

   SAS hopes to receive approval from U.S. authorities to fly to an unlimited number of American destinations, instead of the four U.S. cities it currently can serve. 
But Mr. Abrahamsson denied that SAS was trying to use the jet order to pressure the U.S. 

   SAS signed a letter of intent last December to purchase 12 McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets for an estimated $1.6 billion. 
But in January it received a proposal from Airbus that it buy the European consortium's A-340 jets. 
It said then that it would make a final decision by late March. 

   However, Mr. Abrahamsson said Friday that the decision will be put off for "a number of months." 

   The new planes, which would be delivered in the early 1990s, are to replace SAS's fleet of DC-10s, which at decade's end will total 11.
